            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not to be expected in this inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring age, wherein through the good providence of God, truth hath ſome libertie to ſhew her face and many alſo are travailing in paine to bring forth that man-childe; but there will be likewiſe a ſpirit of errour as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and ready to put off his ware in this open market, as the ſpirit of truth; and eſpecially in this Kingdome where the people generally have been ſo long trained up in the ſtrength of rationall notion, made out by the arts and parts of nature; who will be eaſily drawne to trade with ſuch as have beſt skill to ſet out their ware upon the ſtrongeſt termes of the creatures reaſon. For he that can preſent the richeſt jewel in reaſons treaſure, is like to carrie away<note n="*" place="margin">That is, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall affection ſwayed by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all things.</note> the faireſt daughter that nature hath. Which cauſeth ſo much diviſion and contention among men profeſſing Religion, as that many of the godly can hardly tell where to ſet a foot upon found ground, to the great ſadding of their ſpirits, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of many away from the truth. The conſideration of which cauſed me to hold forth that light I have from the Lord in theſe two ſubjects.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:113580:3"/>
            <p>Firſt, That as God hath a people whom he calls and owns out of the world, even ſo hath he among all er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and by-paths, a truth, and a true way for ſuch to obſerve and to walk with him in, a part from the world and the rudiments thereof, as witneſſes to the truth in the profeſſion of the ſame, according to the rule of truth, left to all his in his laſt Teſtament; wherein all that profeſſe him, ſhall be confeſſed of him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Unto theſe Chriſt hath preached, and God hath aſſigned ſuch priviledges as are not common to the world, out of which he cals them to injoy the ſame. As Chriſt himſelf; even ſo all things by him are for ſuch to injoy as believe in him, and no more. For as the end was firſt minded in Gods ordering of the means, even ſo in all the cauſes concurring to effect the ſame, the end muſt ever be minded as the life and ſtrength of the cauſe; ſo that as God choſe perſons in Chriſt, and gave them to him to be ſaved by him, ſo their ſinnes were laid upon him, for them he died, roſe againe, aſcended, and appeares in Gods holy preſence, preſenting them perfect in himſelfe. Unto him all ſuch ſhall come as were given to him, and had their ſinnes laid upon him, for him to give ſatisfaction for them. All ſuch ſhall be ſaved from all their ſinnes by him; that being the end for which they were laid upon him.</p>
            <p>This I believe to be a truth that deſerves no aſperſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be caſt upon it, nor tends to cauſe any diviſion or contention among ſuch as walke by faith in the light of truth; though the rationall ſtrength of nature in her owne wiſdome cannot reſt here ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>And thus in ſumme, Chriſtian Reader, I preſent to thy view the ſubject I deale upon, endeavouring to maintaine the right &amp; priviledges purchaſed by Chriſt,
<pb facs="tcp:113580:3"/>and freely given to all that believe in him for ſalvation, againſt ſuch as oppoſe the ſame: who under pretence of ſeeking the truth, doe by cunning and craſtie enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries undermine the ſame, and (as they of old did) over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the faith of ſome: who deny unto ſuch as do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Jeſus Chriſt for eternall life, Church fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and communion with Chriſt in his Ordinances of the new Teſtament, for want (as they ſay) of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery with power from God to call and fit a people for Ordinances, and to adminiſter the ſame.</p>
            <p>This opinion much oppreſſeth and diſturbs the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for whoſe ſakes I have endeavoured to hold forth my portion of light, for ſuch as belive to conſider well the freedome &amp; priviledge of faith in all the free pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of Chriſt, and gifts of grace; and to hold faſt the libertie wherewith Chriſt hath made them free, &amp; not to be brought into bondage by men. And as none are to loſe any priviledge they have by Chriſt, no more are any ſo to be ſatisfied with a right to all things in Chriſt, as to neglect their dutie to him, in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of him, in holding out an holy fellowſhip and communion with him in all thoſe relative properties of a wife to a husband, and a body to a head, in ſuch or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by himſelfe appointed, as may ſerve to the honour of his crowne and dignitie, declaring him to be the firſt borne among them, and to have the pre eminence over them. This being the end for which God ſanctified him, for him to call and ſanctifie a people, to keep him a name and praiſe in the earth, that glory might be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to God in the Church y Chriſt through all ages: and not for ſuch as believe in him, to give away, as far as in them lies, his glory, name, and praiſe, by forſaking of their priviledges, and therein denying themſelves to
<pb facs="tcp:113580:4"/>be veſſels of mercy, called to hold forth the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Word, to the glory of his Grace. This cauſed me to lay all ſo cloſe to the try all of Scripture, which diſclaims ſuch faith as brings not man to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of truth, that God may have his glory from man, as well as man his ſalvation of God, who hath not tied his childrens benefits by Chriſts purchaſe, to this or that condition and qualification, but given them in the hand of Grace to a believing heart: ſo that they lie clear and free from God in his Word, to faith without exception. For though that all came from God to Chriſt for man, and freely through Chriſt to man, yet all is limited by the Goſpel to a believing ſubject, and ſo are all the tenders of the ſame onely upon termes of faith; which might ſatisfie ſuch as have faith, that it was never otherwiſe minded with God in giving his Son, nor with Chriſt in his dying for ſin: which faith would ſoon put an end to all the difference about the generall point, if it might be Judge. But that being grounded upon a rationall notion, &amp; ſtrove for, and ſtrengthened by reaſon's miſ-underſtanding ſome generall termes of Scripture, reaſon falling farre ſhort of the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of faith, attended with ſalvation; faith muſt either ſubmit to reaſon, or reaſon to faith, before the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference can be ended. And where theſe ſeeme to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled in one that profeſſeth faith, it is but as of old with ſuch as (according to the Apoſtles ſaying) <hi>began in the ſpirit, and ended in the fleſh.</hi> But of thee, courteous Reader, I deſire better things, and ſuch as accompany ſalvation.

Or rather thus, to the ſame effect; It comes to paſſe concerning the kingdom of heaven, as when a man findeth a treaſure bid in a field, &amp;c. So in <hi>verf. 24. The kingdome of heaven is likened to a man which ſowed,</hi> &amp;c. Yet in <hi>verf. 37.</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>He that ſoweth the good ſeed, is the Son of man.</hi> Whereas ſome affirme that the Elect are this treaſure, and the man finding this treaſure, in Chriſt; this groſſe abſurditie neceſſarily followes; <hi>viz.</hi> that we were a treaſure, and ſo to be looked upon, not onely before Chriſt redeemed us, but alſo before be any way found us. To ſay nothing of this, that it is not agreeable to Scripture-phraſe, to ſay that Chriſt ſold all that be had to buy the world: but to ſay that be ſuffered death, that he might purchaſe his Church with his owne bloud, <hi>Acts 20.28.</hi> Whereas Chriſt ſaith in <hi>Mat. 13.38. The field is the world:</hi> he doth not mean that by <hi>the field</hi> we muſt underſtand <hi>the world</hi> in every place of Scripture, or in every Parable, or in this Parable; but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in that Parable which Chriſt there expounds. The <hi>treaſure hid in the field</hi> is Chriſt, and that treaſure of grace which is in him. The field in which this treaſure is bid, may be the Word and Ordinances. There Chriſt is as it were bid: for although it be given to the Elect to ſee him there, yet the world there ſees him not. The man finding this treaſure, is an Elect perſon now brought to ſee Chriſt with the eye of faith. His hiding this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſignifies his high eſteeming of it, and his care not to be deprived of it. His ſelling all that be hath, and buying this field, ſhewes his looking upon all things as loſſe in compariſon of Chriſt; and his being content to part with all things that be may enjoy Chriſt in his Word and Ordinances; and his deſire and care ſo to enjoy him, whatſoever loſſe or affliction he muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe for the ſame. Wee have now earneſtly laboured in the uſe of that ſtrength that God hath given us, to ſhew unto thee, if thou believeſt in Chriſt, that this treaſure is thine, and that thou oughteſt to take notice of thy right thereunto through Gods gift, and to enjoy the ſame as peculiar to thee and the reſt of the faithfull, and not common to the world.</p>

            <p>I am informed that ſome offence is likely to be taken at the word <hi>adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries,</hi> uſed in the ſecond Treatiſe. If any offence be there given in the uſe of that word, I onely muſt beare the blame of it. Therefore permit me to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe bow I underſtood it, of whom I meant it, and what induced me to the uſe of it. <hi>1.</hi> By <hi>adverſaries</hi> I underſtood onely <hi>oppoſers,</hi> and namely, oppoſers of our doctrine. <hi>2.</hi> I intended not this title to all that do not fully cloſe with us in judgement; but to thoſe that ſo oppoſe us, as that they deny us to preach any Goſpel, to bold forth any true faith, or to adminiſter any true Baptiſme; who have openly called us The gates of bell, their common enemie, &amp;c. <hi>3.</hi> This their dealing with u did move me to give them that title; and I conceived, I had juſt cauſe ſo to doe. But now I confeſſe, the caſe ſtands with me concerning the uſe of this terme, and concerning any ſharpneſſe that I can now diſcerne in any paſſage of mine in this Treatiſe, as it ſtood with <hi>David</hi> when he had cut off <hi>Sauls</hi> skirt. But touching the doctrine maintained in this Treatiſe, I am ſo farre from recalling any part of it, that I count my ſelfe bound, if the Lord ſhall call me to it, to ſeale it with my bloud. And I have cauſe to bleſſe God for this opportunitie which be hath given me, thus to aſſiſt in the publick aſſerting and clearing of this truth. And ſo much the rather, becauſe I have ſometimes not been ſo cleare in the ſight of it, as through the goodneſſe of God, I now am. Yet even then I held and maintained, <hi>that the Lord Chriſt giving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to ſuffer death, intended (according to his Fathers will from all eternitie) by his death effectually to procure the eternall ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the Elect, and onely of them.</hi> This I grounded upon theſe principles. <hi>1.</hi> The eternitie and immutabilitie of Gods counſaile. <hi>2.</hi> Gods ſpeciall love to the Elect, and their being ſaved through the ſame. <hi>3.</hi> The wiſdome and power of Chriſt, intending what be effecteth, and effecting what be intended.</p>
            <p>In the tranſcribing and enlarging of this Treatiſe, I was much ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in time; but I found the Lord more then ordinarily ſtrengthening me: Whereupon I am the more confirmed, that he meanes to make this Treatiſe a meane of good unto his, when they ſhall diligently peruſe it. Neither doe I queſtion his following of the firſt Treatiſe alſo with his effectuall bleſſing. So commending this whole Booke to thy ſerious peruſall, and thee to the grace of the Almighty; I reſt</p>

            <head>THE SAINTS INTEREST BY Chriſt in all the Priviledges of Grace.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here be two Queſtions that are deſired to be anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: The firſt is; <hi>Whether ſuch as believe in Jeſus Chriſt for ſalvation, may injoy the Ordinances of the new Teſtament; namely,</hi> Baptiſme, and the Lords Supper, <hi>now under the reigne of Antichriſt. And ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that all the true and right adminiſtrations, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the firſt order and patterne, have been loſt through the myſtery of confuſion in the world; How wee ſhall now come by a true and orderly adminiſtration of Ordinances according to the firſt inſtitution; if not by the ſame Miniſtery, with the ſame calling and gifts of the holy Spirit that the firſt Miniſtery had.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond Queſtion is; <hi>How farre the death of Chriſt extended to the taking away the ſin of man; whether he dyed for the ſinnes of all men without exception, or for the ſinnes of ſome onely.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Unto the firſt Queſtion, I ſhall by the help of God now addreſſe my ſelfe to an anſwer. And firſt, I ſay, that ſuch as believe in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt in the Scripture-ſenſe, may and ought to enjoy the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Chriſts new Teſtament, as their own free Priviledges by Grace, and part of their inheritance, as they are heires of glory, and that even during the reigne of Antichriſt; for then have they moſt need of them, as being Chriſts their Generalls colours, and part of that ſpirituall armour by which they are to fight againſt the Beaſt, and all falſe wayes, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.12, 13. They are the memorialls of Chriſts love unto all that believe in him, and look for him in his abſence, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.19. With 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.24, 25, 26. And the Ordinances of Chriſts Teſtament are given to ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, for the helps and confirmation of their faith, and the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:113580:6"/>thereof, and thereby God ſeparates them from the world, and owns them for his people. And for the ſame Miniſtery, with the ſame calling, and gifts of the holy Spirit, that the firſt had; I own no other Miniſtery.</p>
            <p>But for the better underſtanding of this truth, I deſire that wee may conſider well of an anſwer to ſome inquiries: thus;</p>
            <p n="1">1. What worke God had for the firſt Miniſtery, above what he hath for any now?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whether Chriſt hath left in his New Teſtament an abſolute rule to know ſuch as are ſent of God to the work of the Miniſtery, and what the ſame is?</p>
            <p n="3">3. If there be ſalvation now for men, and meanes thereunto ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, and appointed of God, then what that is?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Whether there be any time in which man is freed from obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Scriptures, ſince the New Teſtament came in force; and if not, then what part of truth ſtands now in force to be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and what not?</p>
            <p n="5">5. Whether the New Teſtament be not of equall Authoritie with the Old, to command obedience, and holds not forth a rule for the ſame, as the old Teſtament did?</p>
            <p n="6">6. Whether Chriſt requires not a publick confeſſion of him, by all that believe in him; and if he doe, then what the ſame is, and the rule for it?</p>
            <p>Now to each of theſe particulars. And firſt, what worke God had for the firſt miniſtery or workmen to doe above others, either then, or now: Where in generall minde; The worke God had for the firſt workmen, was firſt, to be eye-witneſſes of Chriſts doings and ſufferings, death and reſurrection; and ſo to teſtifie him to be the Son of God, come in the fleſh, and exalted to be Lord over all, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.39.—42. <hi>Acts</hi> 4.33. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.1, 2.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They were to diſanull and make voyd that typicall way of worſhip, ſtanding under types and ſhadows, inſtituted by God, and confirmed to the people by ſignes and wonders, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.9. And to ſet up and eſtabliſh another way of worſhip in the place thereof, that was never knowne before, and therefore to be confirmed by ſignes and wonders, at the firſt founding of it, as that before was. Which ſignes and wonders ſtand for ever together with the ſame truth, as witneſſes for the truth, and againſt all that ſhall oppoſe
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:113580:6"/>or condemne the ſame to the end of the world. And whereas many look and expect for ſome to come from God, working miracles, ſignes, and wonders, let ſuch take heed they be not deceived by the man of ſinne, who is ſet out by God in his Word to come that way and deceive many, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.24. <hi>Mark.</hi> 13.22. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.14. <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.20. But where is one word in all the new Teſtament, that any man ſhall come from God in this manner, of working mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, ſignes, and wonders?</p>
            <p n="3">3. They were to the people then, the unerring Oracles of God, and the infallible mouth of Chriſt for all to have recourſe unto, for the minde and counſell of God; whoſe teſtimony was unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable, being that by which all things muſt be tryed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19, 20. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8, 9. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.1.—7.</p>
            <p n="4">4. They were the layers of the foundation, and the miniſteriall inſtituters of the whole ſtate and order of Chriſts Church to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved of all to the end of the world, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.10, 11. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.20. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.14.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, They were the pen-men of the holy Scriptures of the new Teſtament, in which Chriſt is held forth, or ſet up as an enſigne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all Nations for the obedience of faith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.14. <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.31. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 52.10. By which all both perſons and actions ſhall be tryed and judged, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.37. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.16. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.8. This worke God had for the firſt workmen, or miniſtery to doe, who bare witneſſe to the ſame, by ſignes, wonders, and miracles from heaven, for the convincing of the world, that the ſame was of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.20. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.8, 9, 10, 11. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.20, 21. There are now no more inſtituters or beginners of any ſuch work; All that men have to doe now is onely to learn their way, and to walke in the ſame, and ſo to believe and receive their teſtimony, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.16. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.10. And to build upon the ſame foundation laid by them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.10, 11, 12. The rule and warrant for the ſame, being their word and writings aforeſaid. Yet let this be minded, that ſome of the worke in the hands of the firſt work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, namely, the Apoſtles, was then, and is now, as proper and common unto others, as to them; As to preach the Goſpel, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Elect of God into the fellowſhip of Chriſts body; to beare witneſſe to the truth, and to ſuffer for the ſame, and the like. All which as well belongs to preaching Diſciples now, as to them then, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.20, 21. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4.2.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:113580:7"/>
            <p>If it be ſaid,<note place="margin">Object. <hi>1.</hi>
               </note> where the ſame worke is to be done, there the ſame workmen are required for the doing of it, both in reſpect of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery and Gifts, becauſe the Scriptures hold forth but onely one Miniſtery, appointed and given by Chriſt, for the work of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, which is to continue to the end of the world, where and when the ſaid worke is to be done, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.</p>
            <p>This I confeſſe and affirme to be true;<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> but let us minde in a word what all this is; The worke to be done, is to call home the Elect of God, into the faith and fellowſhip of Chriſt. The Miniſtery, are men ſtirred up, and ſent by Chriſt, with gifts and abilities fit for the worke called unto. Which Miniſtery remaines untill all the Elect of God are brought unto one unity of faith and fulneſſe of Chriſt, as <hi>Eph.</hi> 4 <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. But what gifts and abilities are of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſitie required by Chriſt unto this worke, is well to be minded. To gather the Elect of God into the fellowſhip of Chriſt, and to edifie them in the ſame, is the worke. And God inlightening men in the knowledge of the myſtery of Chriſt, in the Principles of the Goſpel, and the Spirit inabling them with gifts of utterance, to preach the ſame, for the convincing of ſinne, and to bring over the heart to believe, and ſubmit to Chriſt, and to teach them their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to God and man; here is now the workmen, or Miniſtery, that Chriſt gave, and is to continue to the end of the world, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19, 20.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid,<note place="margin">Object. <hi>2.</hi>
               </note> The diverſities of tongues are of neceſſitie for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of Chriſt, becauſe they are to preach the Goſpel unto all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.15.</p>
            <p>The Goſpel indeed is to be preached unto all Nations,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> that is, to one nation as well as to another, excluding none, as before the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles were, but now to all, ſeeing God is the God of the Gentiles, as well as of the <hi>Jewes, Rom.</hi> 3.29. For now Chriſt by his death hath opened a free way for the Goſpel, to goe into all the world, to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Elect out of every nation, tongue, and people, <hi>Zech.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.31. <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.9. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 54.1, 2.3.</p>
            <p>But this rather ſeems to be by ſome inſtruments whom God ſhall ſtirre up in every nation of their owne language, then by all lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages in one man; which thing was never yet knowne, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 19.18.25. <hi>Zech.</hi> 8.20, 21, 22, 23.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Tongues are of neceſſitie for ſuch to ſpeake unto a people, to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:113580:7"/>whom they are ſent, and Chriſt never ſends any man to preach, or with a meſſage to a people or perſon, but he gives him a tongue at the preſent to deliver the ſame. And more then is uſefull herein, is not of neceſſitie.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That all tongues to ſpeake all languages ſhould be ſo eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to the Miniſtery of Chriſt, that there can be no true Miniſtery without them: this lies to be proved; for it is very queſtionable whether all the ſeverall languages, by which God did confound and ſcatter the people, <hi>Gen.</hi> 11.6, 7, 8, 9. were ever yet all knowne to any one man; and if not, then how ſhall any man know when he hath them all? But if it be granted, that onely ſo many tongues as are needfull: this I freely confeſſe, muſt be in the Miniſtery of Chriſt, and no more are required of neceſſitie.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Where the diverſities of tongues are not of uſe for the well being of a Church, they cannot be of abſolute neceſſitie for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that Church. But ſtrange tongues are not of uſe for the well being of a Church that underſtands them not, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.27, 28. and therefore not of abſolute neceſſitie for the being of it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The firſt Church of the new Teſtament, which may be our chiefe pattern, conſiſting of the hundred and twentie Diſciples, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. was neither converted or conſtituted by a Miniſtery of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſitie of tongues, and yet by a true Miniſtery of Chriſt. Theſe were in Church-fellowſhip before the diverſities of tongues were given, who were a Church, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. To whom the 3000. were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and converted by the tongues given, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The want of ſuch diverſities of tongues will not excuſe a mans ſilence, much leſſe prohibite the uſe of ſuch tongues as for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent men have of God, to declare and publiſh what light and truth the Lord doth reveale, and ſo much the more, ſeeing every man ſtands accountable of himſelfe to God, for every gift and meaſure of light and truth he receives of the Lord, for the improvement thereof, to the glory of God and good of man, as theſe Scriptures compared together doe manifeſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.11.—15. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.40, 41. —47. with <hi>Mark.</hi> 13.34.37. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. Which Scriptures ſpeake of the Lords coming, and the condition both of times and perſons the mean while in his abſence, with their work charged upon them, ſo as that they are at no time freed from the ſame, untill his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to take an account of them. And it is a vaine thing for any man
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:113580:8"/>to thinke he ſhall be excuſed by his pleading the want of tongues to ſpeake all languages, and the like, but rather expect to be called to account, how he hath improved that abilitie and tongue which he hath for his Lord and Maſters advantage, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.14, 15, 24, 25, 26, 27. And thus men are to improve what abilities they have received to the glory of God; and when he cals them to grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter worke, he will give them anſwer able abilities for the ſame, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tongues, or elſe, as <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.11.13. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.18, 19, 20.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, The Miniſtery which Chriſt hath now in his Church, hath as many tongues, and I conceive can ſpeak as many languages, as that Miniſtery which converted and planted the firſt Goſpel-Church of Chriſts new Teſtament, which may be well our exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And as God did honour and beautifie his Church and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery then, by powring out of his Spirit in ſuch a meaſure upon them, ſo he may doe in his owne time upon his Church and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery now as the ſees occaſion, when the hath tryed who are the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſers of the day of ſmall things.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid,<note place="margin">Object. <hi>3.</hi>
               </note> that by the power of darkneſſe over-ſpreading the whole world, the true Church, Miniſtery, and Ordinances, have all been loſt, and a falſe Antichriſtian forme come in the place. There muſt be now as at the firſt, an immediate Miniſtery ſent of God, with the holy Ghoſt and power to reſtore the ſame againe.</p>
            <p>The Church,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> Miniſtery, and Ordinantes, are not loſt to the Scriptures, the Spirit, and faith, but onely to the world, as all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and heavenly things are ſubject to be, through their oppoſing and deſpiſing of them.</p>
            <p>But it's ſaid,<note place="margin">Object. <hi>4.</hi>
               </note> the Adminiſtrations of theſe were loſt, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Adminiſtrations were not loſt to Word, Spirit, and faith;<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> for all the holy things of God lie cleare and free in the Word to whomſoever the Spirit reveales them, and gives faith to believe, by which they become one, and riſe together.</p>
            <p>But ſome may ſay,<note place="margin">Object.</note> ſhew us now a true Adminiſtrator ſent of God.</p>
            <p>So much in effect ſaid the <hi>Jewes</hi> of old to Chriſt,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> 
               <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.30. and the oppoſers of Gods truth to the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.3. But let ſuch ſhew us believers approved ſo by God after Chriſts Reſurrection, without which there is no ſalvation, and then will I by the helpe of the Lord ſhew a true Adminiſtrator ſent of God, which indeed
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:113580:8"/>were never apart in Chriſts new Teſtament, neither ought they to be aſunder now. But all the difficulty is, how to know one that is truly ſent of God to the worke of the Miniſtery; and for this let us ſee what abſolute Rule or way Chriſt hath left in his new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to know ſuch by. Now for any abſolute Rule in reſpect of either gift, power, or qualification, to note out a man ſent of God to the worke of the Miniſtery, diſtinct from the ſame work I know none. But ſuch as Chriſt ſtirres up and ſends to the worke of the Miniſtery, they are declared by the work as it anſwers to the Rule; for as the Scriptures juſtifie the worke, and own that to be of God, even ſo doth the ſame Word juſtifie the workman, and owns him to be ſent of God about the ſame. Thus did Chriſt appeale to his worke for witneſſe to prove himſelfe to be ſent of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.37, 38. &amp; 14.11. And ſo did the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.2. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3. And ſo are all to be knowne by walking in their footſteps and bringing their doctrine, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.17, 18. Such as God enables to preach the ſame Goſpel, and to bring men to believe in Jeſus Chriſt, and to give up themſelves in obedience to his will. Such whoſe gifts and abilities improved, doe hold forth Chriſt as an enſigne to the Nations, and gather preſons into one unitie of faith, and fellowſhip of Chriſt: in ſuch appeares the Miniſtery and spirit of Chriſt, and this declares them to be ſent of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11.—16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14, 15. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.2. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.2.3. 2 <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.<note place="margin">Object. <hi>5.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>Some will ſay, There is not thoſe gifts and abilities for the work of the Miniſtery now, as was with Chriſt and the Apoſtles, and therefore not the ſame Miniſtery.</p>
            <p>As there is not thoſe gifts and abilities for meaſure now,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> as was then, ſo there is not that occaſion for the ſame now, as I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſhewed. God enables men now with abilities and gifts, as the worke requires, which is to diſcover and lay out the foundation, and to fit and prepare the matter, and to build it upon the ſame, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. That is, to preach Chriſt crucified, and to bring perſons to believe on him, and baptize them into the profeſſion of him. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Act.</hi> 8.4, 5.12. <hi>Act.</hi> 11.20, 21. This was the worke of the Miniſtery then, and is the ſame now, done by the ſame Spirit, who is above all his gifts. And no greater power, gifts, and abilities was ever in any, or can be expected, then to bring ſoules to God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.23, 24. with <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.12. Which worke is done
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:113580:9"/>now as truly as ever, and therefore there is the ſame power; for now the dead are raiſed; the eyes of the blind opened; the Devils ſpiritually caſt out; the ſame walke; the ſicke reſtored to health; and the poore receive the Goſpel: and what more can be required to declare a true Miniſtery of Chriſt?<note place="margin">Object. <hi>6.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>Such as profeſſe themſelves to be the Miniſters of Chriſt, as the firſt were, muſt be ſo ſent, and have the ſame authoritie from Chriſt as they had.</p>
            <p>All this is true,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> and therefore, I ſay, as before, that ſuch as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a Meſſage from Chriſt, with gifts and abilitie to deliver the ſame to a people, God aſſiſting his Word with a bleſſing and power to bring in the heart to believe and receive the ſame; ſuch may as truly be ſaid to be ſent of God, as the firſt were, neither can we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect any to come from God any other way; and their authoritie is from the Lord Chriſt, who by his Word and Spirit commands to preach, and baptize; and that upon no other condition or terms but onely faith, <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.15, 16. <hi>Act.</hi> 8.36, 37. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.20, 21. For where the power of God goes with his Word to call men to the knowledge of the truth, there is alſo the ſame power to admit ſuch into the obedience of the ſame, <hi>Mark.</hi> 28.18, 19, 20. <hi>Act.</hi> 10.34, 35.47. So that the ſame Spirit, Word, and faith, brings ſuch as have it now under the ſame power and authorities, as one together with the former; as theſe Scriptures compared to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether doe manifeſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.15. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.48. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.17.18. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.10. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12. ſee <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.37.— 42. with <hi>Mark.</hi> 13.37. What other ſending had <hi>Philip</hi> that gathered the Church as <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria,</hi> Act. 8. and the ſcattered Brethren that planted the Church at <hi>Antioch,</hi> Act. 11.19, 20, 21. and <hi>Apollos,</hi> who was an able Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Goſpel, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3? All which the Word holds out to be able Miniſters of the Goſpel, and preaching the ſame. But what ſending had they who called them to it? and by what authoritie did they doe it, more then men of the ſame Spirit, and faith, have now?<note place="margin">Queſt.</note>
            </p>
            <p>How can ſuch preach the Goſpel order, and receive others to the ſame, that never were in it themſelves?</p>
            <p>If we ſay,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> How ſhall men preach truth, that never underſtood truth? This indeed none can doe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. But if it be ſaid, that none can hold forth, or preach the Goſpel-order, untill they be firſt
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:113580:9"/>in it themſelves, then it might be demanded how ſuch came to be in it, and who admitted them unto it? for ſome muſt be firſt, where there is a beginning. Obedience to God depends upon nothing but onely his word that gave being to order, and the Goſpel-order once inſtituted ſtands firme ſtill for all that believe to enter upon it, as living master upon the foundation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. which is Chriſt, who calls all ſuch as living ſtones to come unto him, and be built upon him, a ſpirituall houſe, an holy Prieſthood to offer up ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſacrifices acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt, who hath made a free and open way for all that believe to come with boldneſſe into the Moſt holy place, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4, 5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. And much more to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy all thoſe priviledges of grace inferiour to the ſame, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22. And when any lie ſhort of truth, as touching the Goſpel-order, and the like, it is onely the God of truth that brings up his creaturo to the obedience of truth. And ſuch as God ſo workes in by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as the underſtanding is inlightened in the truth, the conſcience convicted by it, and the man hath faith in it, as his dutie to obey it, with the way open for it, and the Word calling to it. Such by mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall agreement with truth, are by faith one together in truth; which gives being to an orderly practiſe of truth. To ſuch Chriſt opens, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. Such the spirit guides, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. Such God approves, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. The word of God commands them, and faith in them obeyes, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. And thus by the power of truth, ſuch as believe come to be one in Chriſt, with the God of truth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.</p>
            <p>The order of Chriſts new Teſtament, is the adminiſtration of the gracious new Covenant, and of the ſame nature with it, which lies for ever free in all the branches and priviledges thereof, to ſuch as believe, who are the onely true-borne heires of all that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the ſaid new Covenant. And ſo of the order and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the Goſpel, which are but the Adminiſtrations thereof. Now the heire being once put in poſſeſſion of his inheritance, with the priviledges thereof, aſſigned to him, and conferred upon him, free without any condition, but onely his faith; here he is for ever to ſtand, and keepe his poſſeſſion. And if at any time he through ignorance, and unbeliefe, miſtake his freedome, and lies ſhort of his priviledges, then when God his Father ſhall acquaint him with it, and ſhew him the ſame, he may, nay ought by vertue of his firſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, enter upon his in horitance, without looking and his or that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:113580:10"/>or qualification of perſon, to admit him in, but onely that his inheritance be diſcovered, and his right to it. That is, an order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly communion of ſuch as believe, with the Spirit to guide as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, for there is no exception by God againſt ſuch as believe. And faith is the ſame at one time that it is at another, and in one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that it is in another, and ſo are all the Priviledges of Grace the ſame to ſuch as believe at one time as at another.</p>
            <p>The Scriptures hold forth the Adminiſtrators to be ſuch as were baptized perſons;<note place="margin">Object. <hi>7.</hi>

            <p n="1">1.<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> What though none but baptized perſons did baptize, it doth not follow, that none but ſuch muſt baptize, except God had ſo ſaid: we finde not Chriſt confining the diſpenſing of Baptiſme in the hands of baptized perſons, and excluding others: neither is there any example where ever any that did baptize, were examined whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they themſelves were baptized.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Scriptures no where expreſly hold out the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to be baptized perſons, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> onely excepted; for of none but him doth the holy Spirit any where ſpeak expreſly of their being baptized.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The word of God holds out ſuch to baptize others, that were not baptized themſelves; as <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt: who was there to baptize him, before he baptized others?</p>

Otherwiſe, as for them to be agents to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very the Spirit, as from themſelves unto any, this the Apoſtle denies, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5, 6, 7. but onely as in ſtruments by preaching the Goſpel, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. with <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.2. ſo it is now as truly as it was then, God giving in his Spirit of life into mens hearts by preaching of the Word of life. And for the appearing of the holy Spirit by laying on of hands, as <hi>Acts</hi> 8.17, 18. <hi>Act.</hi> 19.6. This was proper onely to the Apoſtles themſelves, as <hi>Act.</hi> 8.14.— 18. where <hi>Philip,</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and planted this Church at <hi>Samaria,</hi> had not the Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the gifts of the holy Spirit, which came afterwards by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of hands by <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> who were ſent by the Apoſtles from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> verſ. 14.17. Neither doe we finde any in this worke but onely the Apoſtles; after whoſe deceaſe the holy Spirit appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not ſo full and rich in his gifts, as he did in them. As it was of old, after the laſt Prophets that wrote Scripture were deceaſed, there was not that meaſure of the Spirit to be found in any untill Chriſt came, that appeared in them: and yet they held faſt ſtill the profeſſion of the name of God under thoſe inſtituted Ordinances that they once were put in poſſeſſion of, according to what light they had, which was very darke to what they had at the firſt. And many things were altered from what was appointed by God at the firſt; as the order of the high Prieſts for one; and this they did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all their captivities and conditions untill Chriſt came in the fleſh. And ſo are all believers to doe under their captivitie by the Antichriſtian worlds tyrannie, <hi>vizs.</hi> to hold faſt the proſeſſion of Chriſt under thoſe inſtituted Ordinances they were once put in free proſſeſſion of, untill Chriſt come againe in power, and the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his glory, and ſet them fully free, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.25. &amp; 22.12.<note place="margin">Object. <hi>9.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>As of old in <hi>Iſrael</hi> there was a ceſſaion of Ordinances in their temporall captivitie, and chiefly that in <hi>Babylon:</hi> and at their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne there was a prohibition from eating of the moſt holy things, untill there ſtood up a Prieſt with Urim and Thummim, <hi>Ezra</hi> 2, 62. <hi>Neh.</hi> 7.65. So it is to be with the godly now in their captivitie in ſpirituall <hi>Babylon,</hi> whereof that was a type.<note place="margin">Anſw.</note>
            </p>
            <p>It doth not to me appeare, that in <hi>Iſraels</hi> captivities there was a ceſſation of Ordinances, no nor yet in that of <hi>Babylon,</hi> but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:113580:11"/>But if it were ſo, yet <hi>Iſrael</hi> in all her captivities was ſtill a true conſtituted Church under that inſtituted Ordinance of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, by which God ſeparated them from all Nations in the world, as a people to himſelfe for his great Name, as he doth now by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme. Which <hi>Iſrael</hi> had ſtill her Miniſtery, and Miniſteriall power and order, and at her returne out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſhee came forth with the ſame, <hi>Ezra</hi> 2.36.70. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3.1.— 6. <hi>Neb.</hi> 3.1. And for the prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, <hi>Ezra</hi> 2.62. this was onely of the houſe of <hi>Habajab, Koz,</hi> and <hi>Barzillai,</hi> whoſe Regiſter could not be found, and therefore they were as polluted put from the Prieſthood, <hi>Ezra</hi> 2.61, 62, 63. And to theſe onely the words are ſpoken, and not of the whole Congregation, who had an high Prieſt, and a Prieſtly power and order, <hi>Neb.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Ezra</hi> 2.36. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3.1.—6.</p>
            <p>So that if there was a ceſſation of Ordinances in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> it was not for want of a Miniſtery, as the caſe is made with us, but as this is our type, then with a true proportion from the type to the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type, we that believe, and ſo are true <hi>Iſrael</hi> in ſubſtance, are not to ceaſe from injoying of our Ordinances for want of a Miniſtery, but to hold faſt our true poſſeſſion and inheritance once delivered into the hand of faith in all our captivitie, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old did.</p>
            <p>Believers now have loſt the poſſeſſion of all Adminiſtrations;<note place="margin">Object. <hi>10.</hi>
               </note> for there hath been a ceſſation for theſe many yeares, both of Miniſtery, Church and Ordinances, according to the firſt Rule and inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt; and therefore men are to waite upon God for him to reſtore the ſame againe in power, and not to take up wayes and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of themſelves.</p>
            <p>Believers never loſt their right to any truth,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> or ordinance of Chriſt, for they by faith doe or ought to poſſeſſe all truth once gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.21, 22, 23. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10. <hi>Jude</hi> 3. And if any depart, and forſake their own mercies through unbeliefe, they are to returne againe to the ſame by faith; and God prohibits none that believe in his Son, the uſe of his Ordinances, ordained by him for their comfort and confirmation of their faith; but helpes them on to the ſame, by giving his Spirit for their guide, his Word for their rule, and himſelfe for their warrant, who commands them to obey him in all truth that he ſhall make knowne unto them. Men are indeed to waite upon the God of truth for him to diſcover truth. But when he hath not onely made it knowne to them, but
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:113580:11"/>alſo revealed truth in them, and by the power of it, made the heart one with it, then men take not up truth of themſelves, but are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up by truth, into the nature of truth, and ſhall ſtand by the power of it; when ſuch as take up truth of themſelves, and for their own ends, ſhall lay it downe againe to their own deſtruction.<note place="margin">Object. <hi>11.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>God ordained a Miniſtery in the Goſpel which ever was in order firſt, namely, Apoſtles, Prophets, and Evangeliſts, by whom Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were planted, and other Officers ordained for thoſe Churches well-being.</p>
            <p>This Miniſtery I confeſſe, and own, and therefore I ſay ſtill,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> that men muſt come from God with truth, and with abilitie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the ſame for the converting of men to the faith. Now when God ſhall aſſiſt his Word with power, to bring over mens hearts to believe, and obey the ſame, ſuch the Scriptures hold out to be true Meſſengers ſent of Chriſt, declared by their worke as it anſwers to the Rule. And this way men were convinced, and Churches plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that now ſtand under the profeſſion of chriſt. And thus came Churches to be planted, and other Officers ordained, by thoſe that God made the firſt inſtruments to bring on the worke, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the reſt, as to direct and aſſiſt them in the ſame, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Act.</hi> 14.23.</p>
            <p>The Miniſtery aforeſaid, to bring men to the faith,<note place="margin">Object. <hi>12.</hi>
               </note> was attended with the power of miracles, as raiſing the dead, healing the ſicke, caſting out devills, and the like, to confirme their teſtimony to be of God, none of which appeares now, whereas there is as much need to confirme the truth of God as ever, among ſo much confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as now is. The like miracles are aſſigned by Chriſt ever to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend his Miniſtery, <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.17. and confirmed by the Apoſtle as an Ordinance of God in his Church, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.14, 15. and the firſt Principles of Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1, 2. All which are now wanting that ſhould confirme a true Miniſtery from God to us.<note place="margin">Anſw.</note>
            </p>
            <p>That the working of miracles did attend the Miniſtery of Chriſt at the firſt, and that to confirme the truth then held forth to be of God, this I confeſſe to be true. But that the working of thoſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles ſhould be ſo eſſentiall to the Miniſtery, that there can be no true Miniſtery of Chriſt, neither in whole, nor in part, without working of the ſaid miracles; that I deny.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>John the Eaptiſt</hi> was a true Miniſter, and ſent of God, who did
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:113580:12"/>no miracle, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.41. and yet he was more then a Propher, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.9. And ſo was <hi>Apollos</hi> a true Miniſter of the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who knew onely the Baptiſme of <hi>John,</hi> and no more, untill that <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla</hi> had further informed him in Gods way, but was never knowne to worke any miracle, <hi>Act.</hi> 18.25, 26—28. with a <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. And likewiſe the ſcattered Diſciples that gathered the Church at <hi>Antioch,</hi> Act. 11.19, 20, 21. All which were true Miniſters of Chriſt, and yet not attended with the foreſaid power of working miracles in their Adminiſtrations.<note place="margin">It is a <hi>Herods</hi> hope to ſee a miracle, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.8. And a <hi>Pharaohs</hi> ſign, <hi>Exod.</hi> 7.9.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Miracles can be no true note of Miniſtery, nor Miniſter ſent of Chriſt, becauſe the working of miracles is that by which falſe Prophets ſhall deceive the people, <hi>Mark.</hi> 13.22. <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.14. <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.20.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The ſame miracles that confirmed the truth at the firſt to be of God, ſtand in equall authoritie, together with the ſame truth, as witneſſes together for God, and againſt all that oppoſe, untill the coming of Chriſt, without adding more miracles to them, any more then of truth to what is written, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.4. Nothing more is now to be expected, then the holy Spirit for to open the Scriptures, and inable men to unfold the minde of God in the ſame; and the ſame Spirit working faith in the hearts of the Elect to believe his own teſtimony of they myſtery of the Fathers love in the Sonne, through the word, without any other miracle. So that if Chriſt inableth men to underſtand, and to open the Word, and God o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens the heart, and the Spirit workes faith; here will need no mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle to bring ſuch to believe.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, As great miracles are done now as ever, to caſt out De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills out of mens ſoules, to open the eyes ſpiritually blind, to raiſe the dead from the death of ſinne. In a word, to bring forth a new creature, and offer up the ſame to God. Theſe are the ſubſtance of all miracles to ſuch as by experience know them, and greater then all, as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.12. And for Chriſts words, <hi>Mark,</hi> 16.17. <hi>Theſe ſignes ſhall follow them that believe,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe ſignes are there ſaid to follow ſuch as believe, and not ſuch as are ſent of Chriſt to preach the Goſpel. The words are to be taken either li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally or myſtically. If myſtically, then all thoſe ſignes are to be taken in a ſpirituall ſenſe; as to caſt out devills by converting of foules to God, in preaching of Chriſt, as afore ſaid; and to ſpeake
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:113580:12"/>with new tongues, is in reference to the new creature, which being of a new nature, he ſpeaks with a new tongue, &amp; ſo a new language, as he never did before, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. according to theſe Scriptures, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 19.18. <hi>&amp;</hi> 35.5, 6. And to take up Serpents, that is, in reſpect of the great worke of the Goſpel, by which God will alter and change the Serpent-like nature of men, unto a Lamb-like temper of ſpirit, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 11.6.—9. and the ſweet peace God will make for his people with ſuch, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.23. And for drinking any deadly thing, it ſhall not hurt ſuch as believe, that is, if they drinke in, at any time, falſe doctrine or errour, which in it ſelfe is poyſon and deadly; but God of his grace will ſo provide that it ſhall not hurt them, ſo as to deſtroy them, but he will recover, and preſerve them by ſome way or other, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.24. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.19, 20. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9.</p>
            <p>But if the words be to be taken literally, then conſider whether the faith may not be the ſame with the ſignes, <hi>viz.</hi> the faith of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles which men might have, and yet periſh, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.22, 23. But grant the faith there ſpoken of to be faith unto ſalvation, ſpoken of in the verſe aforegoing, and the words to be taken literally; yet Chriſt there onely ſhews how the truth of the Goſpel ſhould then be confirmed by ſignes and miracles; but doth not meane that in every age, or in that age, none ſhould be accounted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, but ſuch as could doe ſuch miracles, or ſhew ſuch ſignes; ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28, 29, 30. As touching <hi>James</hi> 5.14, 15. the direction there given is ſtill to be obſerved according as God gives in faith into mens hearts to depend upon the promiſe there made: and ſuch obſervation of that direction in the exerciſe of faith, will ſurely be accompanied with the promiſed ſucceſſe. Neither was it any more in the Apoſtles dayes; for even in that age Saints might and did dye, as well as in ſucceeding ages. And for <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1, 2. there is nothing at all of any miracles; but onely of laying on of hands.</p>
            <p>All therefore that hath been objected, makes nothing to prove the working of miracles a note to declare a true Miniſtery of Chriſt, either in whole or in part, but rather the contrary, now in our dayes. And againe, it is not to the point in hand, what power any perſons were attended with, but to what power or qualified per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Chriſt hath confined the diſpenſing of his Ordinances abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, ſo that none but onely ſuch muſt meddle with the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:113580:13"/>of them. Either let ſuch as condemne our practiſe, hold us out, and confine us to an abſolute Rule from the mouth of Chriſt, or elſe ceaſe to oppoſe us, leſt they oppoſe Chriſt himſelfe and his Saints portion; and ſo at his coming be found in ſtead of feeding, to be ſmiting of the flocke, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. As of old, at the peoples re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne out of temporall <hi>Babylon</hi> in the type, was onely the ſimple call of God without any miracle; even ſo in the antitype, the peoples coming out of ſpirituall <hi>Babylon,</hi> is onely by the ſimple call of God without any miracle, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.4.</p>

            <p>This is but the ſame in effect that I have ever ſaid,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> that if any man goes before he hath a Meſſage from God, and power to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the ſame, ſuch a one goeth of himſelfe unſent: but one who hath a Meſſage, and abilitie to deliver it, God aſſiſting the ſame with power to effect the worke; this now is one truly ſent, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid. But in a word briefly, let us a little minde what this power here is, which the Apoſtles were to waite for as <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> this power was the holy Spirit, the comforter, the Spirit of truth, the promiſe of the Father, as the Scriptures manifeſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.4.8. <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.49. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.4.33. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.16, 17.26. <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.39. The holy Spirit, in reſpect of his ſanctifying power and gifts, the comforter, in reſpect of his evidence in the myſtery of the Fathers love; in which ſenſe he was to ſupply the place of Chriſt, and was not to come untill Chriſt was aſcended, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.16, 17.26. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.7. <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.39. This holy Spirit and comforter, was the promiſe of the Father, received of Chriſt, and is given to all that believe through Grace, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.38, 39. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9.11.14, 15, 16. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.6. Being the holy regenerating Spirit of Grace, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.5, 6. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12, 13. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.9. The comforter that brings the Fathers love through his Sonnes death to a cold heart, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. The witneſſe of all our happineſſe, and the holy Spirit of promiſe, that ſeals us up in the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:113580:13"/>Fathers love, enabling of us to cry Abba Father, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.24. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5.10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15, 16. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13, 14. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.6. All which is onely one and the ſame Spirit, not many, but onely one and no more, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.4.11. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.4. Whoſe Miniſteriall abilides I ſhall reduce unto two heads.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Light and knowledge in the myſtery of Chriſt, in the Goſpel, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.3, 4, 5.6.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Power or abilitie of utterance to preach and teach the ſame, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.19. <hi>Col.</hi> 4.3.</p>
            <p>Let men ſtrive while they will, here is the ſubſtance of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriall power of Chriſt, and according to every mans talent, and abilitie, he is to labour in this worke, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.14, 15. The mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of the Spirit is given to every man (none excepted) to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit withall, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. So that the Meſſage of the holy Spirit is holy and ſound doctrine, ſuch as tends to bring perſons to one unitie of faith, and conformitie to the myſtery of God, and of the Father, and of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.1, 2, 3. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. And the Meſſengers are ſuch as the ſame Spirit ſtirres up, and enableth to deliver the ſame, as aforeſaid. Such are, as it were, the eyes and hands, and feet, of the holy Spirit, to call, and guide, and to goe before, and lead on others. And as God in Chriſt hath received theſe, ſo he doth others brought to him by their Miniſtery.</p>
            <p>This was the power or promiſe of the Father, that they were to waite for, the Spirit to inable them to lay out Chriſt dead and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen for a foundation to beare up the ſpirituall houſe of God; and as Lord and King of that Kingdome preached before to be at hand; and now exalted at Gods right hand, and advanced to the throne of his Father <hi>David;</hi> and to hold him forth among all Nations as the way to life, by faith in his death. All which could not be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched untill Chriſt was aſcended, and the holy Spirit given that muſt teach the ſame.</p>
            <p>And this in briefe was the power the Apoſtles were to waite at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for, and ſo is every man now. Though the holy Spirit appeared then more fully and richer in his gifts then now he doth; yet for the eſſentialls of truth, both for ſalvation by believing in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and profeſſing him under thoſe honourable titles aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned him by his Father, the holy Spirit doth now for ſubſtance appeare the ſame in his Miniſteriall operations, as ever he did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:113580:14"/>Though there be much imperfection and weakneſſe in the creature, this cauſeth not truth to ceaſe from being truth. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there can be no ſalvation for any man; which is the next thing to be examined.</p>
            <p>Having diſcovered the way how to know ſuch as come from God to the worke of the Miniſtery, in Chriſts new Teſtament, which is by their worke as it anſwers to the word of God, which is the Rule of truth;</p>
            <p>I come now to the third particular, namely, Whether there be ſalvation now for man, and a way or meanes thereunto approved, and appointed of God; and if there be, then what the ſame is.</p>
            <p>This being the third inquiry about the Saints enjoying the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of Chriſts new Teſtament, I anſwer directly, that to me it is out of queſtion, there is ſalvation now for man, and meanes to it appointed by God, or elſe none can be ſav'd, and ſo every perſon in the world muſt periſh. But in a word, note what I meane by ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and that is, for one to be in ſuch an eſtate here in Grace, that the word of God juſtifies to be attended with glory hereafter, as follows;</p>
            <p n="1">1. To believe that Jeſus is the Chriſt, the Son of God, ordained of the Father to be the Saviour of man, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.22. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.16. <hi>Act.</hi> 8.37. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And that Chriſt is come, and hath ſuffered in the fleſh, dyed, and riſen againe by the power of God, and is exalted to be Lord over all, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.32, 33.36. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.9.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And that Chriſt by one offering hath made a free and open way into the preſence of his Fathers love, the moſt holy place, for all that believe, to have free acceſſe unto the Father by him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.12.24. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19, 20. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.18. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3.12.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And that by his own bloud he hath waſhed away all the ſinnes of his people, and preſents them to the Father in his own perfection; in whom they are all compleat, and perfected for ever, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.21, 22, 23. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.9, 10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.10.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That Chriſt hath not onely by his bloud redeemed a people from death, condemnation, and the curſe for ſinne, and ſo the guilt of ſinne, but alſo hath redeemed them from among men, and from a vaine converſation, and traditions of men, to an holy confeſſion of him, according to that rule and order inſtituted by him in his
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:113580:14"/>laſt will and Teſtament, ſealed with his bloud, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.9, 10. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.1, 2, 3, 4. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2.9. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.13.—22. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, This truth believed of us, is not onely by the Scriptures preſented to us, and from thence onely learned by us, but alſo made good upon us, and revealed in us by the holy Spirit given unto us, who hath given us an underſtanding to know him that is true, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.20. Which Spirit of truth, as he brings light, and reveales love, ſo by the power of love he ſubdues ſinne, morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the fleſh, and brings up the new creature to God, and draws forth the heart in love to man. And thus in briefe of ſalvation that is now for man, which is a being in the ſweet poſſeſſion of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers love through Chriſt, by faith unto eternall glory.</p>
            <p>Now the meanes approved and appointed of God, for this great worke of ſalvation, is alſo manifeſt, which in generall is, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriall power and operation of the Spirit of God, in what inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſoever he pleaſeth to appeare, and to uſe them for that work, who is limited to none, but commonly doth great things by weake and deſpiſed meanes, that the crowne and glory might reſt on his own head, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.27, 28, 29. And yet there is the ſame meanes now to bring men to God in truth and for ſubſtance, which hath been formerly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For wee have now the holy Scriptures of God, which are to us in the place and ſtead of the perſonall preſence both of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.31. and Chriſt, and his Apoſtles; if God pleaſe to ſpeake to us by them, as he did to his people of old by the other. (Who being dead yet ſpeaketh, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.4.)</p>
            <p n="2">2. Wee heaving this bleſſed word of truth, to reade, ſearch, and ſtudie, and Gods bleſſing being the ſame to us, as to his people for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, he being the ſame God ſtill, and Chriſt the ſame yeſterday, and to day, and for ever, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.8. wee may therefore expect, and doe enjoy the ſame effect with them, which is to underſtand the minde of Chriſt concerning us in the ſame.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We have the ſame Spirit, who enables men to preach Chriſt crucified, which though to ſome a ſtumbling blocke, and to others fooliſhneſſe, yet to many appeares to be the power of God, by which they are brought to believe in Jeſus Chriſt for eternall life and glory. And thus we have the ſame Goſpel, the ſame faith, the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:113580:15"/>ſame Chriſt, and ſo the ſame way to ſalvation as they formerly had; and theſe meanes doth God appoint, and approve, and bleſſe, for the effecting of this great worke of ſalvation to us now, as well as unto others before us, that we together with them may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to praiſe and magniſie the great Name of ſo gracious a God, that hath done ſuch great things for us, to keepe himſelfe a Name, and witneſſe in the earth.</p>
            <p>But ſome demand of us,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> Whether that the Ordinance of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel be now afoot for to bring men to life; according to Chriſts Commiſſion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19, 20.</p>
            <p>There be ſome that ſtrive againſt the Ordinances of God,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> by putting nice diſtinctions in the word <hi>Preaching;</hi> to beare the ſimple hearted in hand, of ſome great matter therein to be minded, and that in the Originall; thinking that every one is not able to deale with them there. But if we were minded to cavill, wee might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of them, how they know that to be the Originall? or the ſome copie Chriſt and his Apoſtles did ſpeak or write? But we ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly demand, whether we may not as well depend upon that tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation in our own tongue, by the helpe of the Spirit of God, to know the minde of Chriſt, in things abſolutely neceſſary for faith, and life, as they upon the Originall, ſeeing that their Originall and our tranſlation hold forth the ſame Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt. They make as if none could ever preach the Goſpel but only ſuch as had, and have the ſame meaſure of the gifts of the Spirit that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles themſelves had, and yet they are at a ſtand about <hi>Philip,</hi> Act. 8. and confeſſe that he did preach in the proper ſignification of the word. But for my part, I freely grant them thus much, that no man can truly preach the Goſpel, but he that hath the ſame Spirit of God that the Apoſtles had And ſo I come to anſwer their demand briefly thus:</p>
            <p n="1">1. As preaching is to deliver a Meſſage received of the Lord, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14, 15. thus it is now afoote.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As preaching is a publiſhing of the Goſpel of Chriſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally, to bring men to the truth, as <hi>Act.</hi> 8.4. <hi>Act.</hi> 11.19, 20, 21. ſo it is now afoote.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As the Diſciples were to preach the Goſpel of Chriſt freely to all perſons without exception, as <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.15. <hi>Act.</hi> 10.34. thus it is now afoote.</p>
            <pb n="21" facs="tcp:113580:15"/>
            <p>Laſtly, As men are to trade with that abilitie given them of Chriſt, for their Lords advantage, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.15. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.10. ſo preaching the Goſpel is now afoote.</p>
            <p>For men are now to improve that abilitie they have received, becauſe that all men are by the ſame Word now as well as then, to give account for the ſame, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.41.48. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.25, 26, 27.30. All which is according to Chriſts Commiſſion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. and no way contrary to the ſame.<note place="margin">Object. <hi>14.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>There is not that converting Miniſtery now abroad in the world that the Word of God holds forth; there is one Miniſtery abroad that converts men unto faith in Chriſt for ſalvation, or juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but the Miniſters labour to keepe ſuch ſtill in the ſin of idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, or falſe worſhip, and then others pretend to convert theſe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by bringing them into order as they ſay, by dipping. But where is that Miniſtery that calls Perſons out of the world, and plants them at once in Church-fellowſhip?</p>
            <p>For ſuch a converſion to faith in Chriſt for ſalvation,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> as fully leaves the ſaid converts in idolatry, and ſhort of the Goſpel-order and fellowſhip; I know no ſuch converſion, Chriſt owning no ſuch faith in him for ſalvation, that brings not perſons out of idolatry unto the fellowſhip of the Goſpel. But what though, there be a Miniſtery abroad that brings perſons but part of the way, and then another that brings the ſame perſons more fully home into fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; This order the Word of God will beare us out in for a truth, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.37, 38. And alſo the <hi>Jewes</hi> they made Proſelytes; and <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, he brought them further; and the Apoſtles they brought the ſame perſons fully home into fellowſhip, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.10.40, 41, <hi>Act.</hi> 18.24.—28. <hi>Act.</hi> 19.1.—7. The ſame order was ſhadowed out in the building of the Temple by King <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 5.6. Where the <hi>Sidonians</hi> hewed timber and ſtone for the houſe of God abroad; but the ſervants of <hi>Solomon</hi> laid them in the building. And this, I ſay, that in reference to the meanes, it is a far harder worke to convert and fit matter for the ſpirituall houſe of God, out of Antichriſts hard and rookie frame, then-out of the heatheniſh and prophane world: and yet not onely the beſt, if I may ſo ſay, but the very worſt of them, hath been from thence called home, and planted in the Lords vineyard. And there muſt be as great a power from God appeare to bring theſe deniers of a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:113580:16"/>priviledges of the Goſpel, from their ſelfe-wiſdome, and carnall principles, unto the ſimplicity of Chriſt, as ever was to caſt out a devill, heale the ſicke, raiſe the dead, or convert any ſinner. And yet our weakneſſe through Gods power hath ſo prevailed, that it hath brought off the chiefeſt of ſinners unto the obedience of the Goſpel, and prophane perſecuters of us have been convinced, and become lovers of God and his truth together with us; and ſo as Serpents have been taken up, and their ſtings pulled out, and of Lions made Lambes: and thus hath Chriſt been pleaſed to honour the Miniſtery which he hath now in his Church, and leaves not himſelfe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out witneſſe againſt ſuch as oppoſe him in the ſame.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Inquiry, Whether there be any time in which man is freed from obedience to the Scriptures ſince the new Teſtament came in force: And if not, then what part of truth ſtands now in force to be obeyed, and what not?</p>
            <p>For man to be freed from obedience to the Scriptures in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, I ſuppoſe none that feare God will once countenance ſuch an opinion; therefore I come more particularly to conſider what part of the Scriptures is now in force, and ſpecially to be knowne, and obeyed. They are thoſe Scriptures that are neceſſary to bring God and man together unto a oneneſſe in Chriſt. And this is the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, which is called the <hi>Word of Reconciliation,</hi> the <hi>Goſpel of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;</hi> which holds forth Chriſt to be King, Prieſt, and Prophet, and the onely way unto the Father; and brings perſons to be of the houſhold of God. Which houſhold is that compoſed order, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted ſtate of Chriſts Church of the new Teſtament, with the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in that order and ſtate, according to the ſame Teſtament; of which Teſtament Chriſt is the Mediator, who hath confirmed the ſame by his own bloud, and ſanctified all things therein contained. All which the Scriptures of the new Teſtament hold forth, and therefore they of all others are to be obeyed; for therein the whole Mediator ſhip of Chriſt, together with the effect of the ſame, and his rule and order for ever to be obſerved, is written for our learning. This Teſtament, and Chriſt the Mediator thereof, and mans ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are all ſo inſeparably joyned together by the holy Spirit, that the Goſpel holds forth no one of theſe without the other; ſo that there is no faith in Chriſt approved of, apart from the word of the Teſtament, of which he is the Mediator. And that faith
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:113580:16"/>which is truly of him, and in him, brings up the heart believing to a profeſſed ſubjection to him. Both which together (<hi>viz.</hi> faith, and the profeſſion of faith) doe give unto a man both a being, and a name in Chriſts Teſtament, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.10. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.26, 27. <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.16. Take away from a man either faith, or the profeſſion of faith, and there is no name found for that man in Chriſts new Teſtament, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22, 23. None are owned either of God, or man, to be members of Chriſt, that are no way under the profeſſion of him; as appeares in <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.32, 33. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.3. And there is now no profeſſion of Chriſt according to the rule of his Word, without Baptiſme, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.16. <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.30, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.26, 27. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.5.</p>
            <p>By all which it appeares, not onely in generall that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the new Teſtament ſtand now in force, and are to be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of all that doe believe; but alſo in particular that the word of the new Teſtament which holds forth Baptiſme, and require the uſe of the ſame, is ſtill in force, and to be obeyed; becauſe the cleare promiſe of the ſaving benefits of Chriſts Mediatorſhip, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations of the new Teſtament, whereof he is Mediator, goe together in the Word, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38. <hi>Act.</hi> 22.16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3, 4, 5. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21.</p>
            <p>And here let it be well minded, how Chriſt encourageth us to the perpetuall obſervation of that rule in <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19.20. by this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; <hi>And lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.</hi> And how the Apoſtle ſignifies it to be our duty, in the uſe of the Supper, to ſhew the Lords death till he come, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. Is not then the word of the new Teſtament, concerning the uſe of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of the new Teſtament, now in force? Let us take good heed that we doe not diminiſh from the word of Chriſt, nor make voyd the ſame, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.19. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.126.</p>
            <p>And ſo I paſſe to the ext inquiry, which is this;</p>
            <p>Whether the new Teſtament, whereof Chriſt is the Mediator,<note place="margin">Qu. <hi>5.</hi>
               </note> be not of equall authoritie with the old Teſtament, (whereof <hi>Moſes</hi> was the Mediator) to command obedience: and holds not forth a rule for the ſame, as the old Teſtament did. This will appeare to be an undeniable truth, that the authoritie of the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is equall with, if not above, the authoritie of the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <pb n="24" facs="tcp:113580:17"/>
            <p n="1">1. The inſtituter, and Law-giver of the new Teſtament is of equall power and authoritie with the inſtituter of the old, being the Sonne of God, who is Lord over all, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.12. <hi>James</hi> 2.1.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Mediator of the new Teſtament is higher, and of greater authoritie, then the Mediator of the old Teſtament, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.1.—6.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The whole ſtate, Lawes, and Ordinances of the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are of a higher and more heavenly nature, then the ſtate and Ordinances of the old Teſtament, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with greater authoritie, and therefore the neglect of obedience thereunto, is by the holy Spirit laid under the greater puniſhment, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.1.—4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.25.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The old Teſtament was confirmed by the bloud, and death of Buls &amp; Goats, and the like, but the new Teſtament is confirmed by the bloud and death of Jeſus Chriſt the Sonne of God, the Lord of life, and therefore of greater authoritie then the old.</p>
            <p>Hereby it is manifeſt, that the authoritie of the new Teſtament, is equall with, if not above the authoritie of the old Teſtament, to command obedience. And touching the rule of the ſame obedience, this is cleare alſo, being of the ſame nature with the Word, or Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament it ſelfe; for that which commands a thing, ſhews alſo what it commands. That command by which a mans wayes ſhall be try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, judged, juſtified, or condemned; that is the rule given by God of mans obedience unto him; and this is the word of Chriſt, as he is the great Prophet of the new Teſtament, and conſequently the Scriptures of the ſame new Teſtament, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.22.23, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20. Chriſt thus commanding obedience with authoritie in the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, and holding forth the rule thereof in the ſame, diſpenſeth neither with things, nor time, nor perſons, <hi>Act</hi> 17.30.31. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.25.</p>
            <p>The new Teſtament requires obedience onely of ſuch as are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame.<note place="margin">Object. <hi>15</hi>

            <p>The Goſpel that declares the authoritie,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> and government of Chriſt, is ſent out into all the world, and holds up him to be Lord of Lords, and King of Kings, before all Nations, and commands and requires obedience and ſubjection of all, without exception; and makes neither age, time, perſon, gift, nor qualification the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mans obedience to the Goſpel, and ſubjection to his Crowne.</p>

            <p>If all in generall are to obey the Goſpel,<note place="margin">Object. <hi>16.</hi>
               </note> then all that come at the outward call, are to be admitted to fellowſhip and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
            <p>All that may be judged to come in obedience and faith, are to be admitted to fellowſhip and communion. And all ought to come and ſubmit and tender themſelves and their ſervice, that their Lord and King might receive them, who doth not receive any but ſuch as come in faith; neither did he otherwiſe intend in the call, but to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver between the good and the bad, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.6, 7.10, 11, 12. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13, 48. <hi>For though many are called, yet few are choſen,</hi> Mat. 20.16. And it is one thing to command ſubjection, and another thing to bid a man immediately and directly to believe he ſhall be ſaved. By refuſing ſubjection unto Chriſt, men pull upon themſelves hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie judgements, and dreadfull deſtruction; and this their deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhall be from the power and juſt ſentence of Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.23. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.34, 35.37, 38. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5.—11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.17, 18. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 60.12. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.8, 9. The Lord Chriſt hath a Lordly right and power in, and over all creatures; and though the ſame doth not yet fully appeare in the effects of it, yet in due time it ſhall, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.8. with <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.15.17. In the meane time, Chriſt the Lord demands his right of all men, and will judge the diſobedient for their diſloyaltie to him, <hi>Jude</hi> 15. <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.27. Yea he requires all, both perſons, ſtates, and powers, to be under ſubjection; who alſo ſhall acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him to be Lord, to the glory of God the Father, who ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued all things under him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.8, 9, 10, 11. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.24, 25. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.9, 10, 11.</p>
            <p>Thus the holy Scriptures hold forth Chriſts power and domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and call for ſubjection to the ſame, of all perſons without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.12. And when Kings and Nations ſhall acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge this, and ſubmit themſelves thereunto, then ſhall they fit downe in peace one with another, and learne to warre no more, <hi>Iſai,</hi> 2.4. <hi>Zech.</hi> 9.10. And ſo ſhall be delivered from thoſe many heavie miſeries and deſtructions which they ſuffer one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for their rejecting and oppoſing the Scepter of Chriſt, their Lord and King; as the <hi>Jewes</hi> of old did. And whereas ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that Chriſts kingly office, to rule, and command, is of no larger extent then his Prieſtly office to redeeme, and to ſave from ſinne and wrath. I doe believe that Chriſt by his kingly power com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:113580:18"/>and rules over both Angels and Devils, and all his enemies, for whom he was never a Prieſt to redeeme them, and ſave them from ſinne. As <hi>David</hi> (a type of Chriſt) was in ſome reſpect King onely of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and yet in the exerciſe of his kingly power for <hi>Iſraels</hi> good, commanded &amp; rules over many heathen Nations and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes: ſo Chriſt is indeed, in ſome ſenſe, and in ſome reſpect King of his own peculiar people only, who onely are they that obey him willingly and ſincerely, and over whom he reignes for their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall good, to make them Kings reigning with him; and yet in the exerciſe of his kingly power for their good, he rules with might over all the world, and juſtly puniſheth all the diſobedience of the whole world. And now I come to conſider of the laſt enquiery, thus;</p>
            <p>Whether Chriſt requires not a publick confeſſion of him,<note place="margin">Qu. <hi>6.</hi>
               </note> by all that believe in him: and if he doe, then what the ſame is, and the Rule for it.</p>
            <p>Now that Chriſt requires a publick confeſſion of him, by all ſuch as believe in him, is ſo cleare in the Scriptures that I ſuppoſe none that believe the Scriptures will deny it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.32, 33. <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.42, 43. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9, 10. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.2, 3.</p>
            <p>But for the more full clearing of this truth, two things muſt be minded:</p>
            <p n="1">1. What we meane by believing in Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What by confeſſion of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Touching the firſt; By believing in Chriſt, I meane that believing that Jeſus is the Chriſt, which <hi>John</hi> ſpeakes of in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.1. That believing with all the heart, which <hi>Philip</hi> ſpake of in <hi>Acts</hi> 8.37. That believing with the heart unto righteouſnes, which <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of in <hi>Rom,</hi> 10.9, 10.</p>
            <p>Touching the ſecond; The confeſſion that Chriſt requires of men ſo believing, is to confeſſe him in his Name and Titles that his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath honoured him with, and ſet him out by, <hi>viz.</hi> To be a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient and onely Saviour, and the Mediatour of the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; as King, Prieſt, and Prophet. A Prieſt to redeeme and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe his people; a Prophet to teach and inſtruct that people; and a King to protect and defend the ſaid people in their obedience to the truth, revealed by him as a Prophet, and by him as a King commanded to be obeyed. And as this is to be knowne and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:113580:18"/>of ſuch as expect life by him: even ſo it is to be confeſſed, by a profeſſed ſubjection to him in the ſame. The Rule of which profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſubjection and confeſſion, is the inſtituted order and adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſts Teſtament; for no other confeſſion doth he approve of, but that which holds him forth to be Jeſus Chriſt, the Sonne of God, come in the fleſh, dead, and riſen againe, aſcended, and exalted at Gods right hand, to the throne of his Father <hi>David;</hi> and ſo to be Lord of Lords, and King of Kings. And ſubmiſſion to the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted order and adminiſtration of Chriſts Teſtament, is an ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned confeſſion of this believing in him, in a profeſſed ſubjection to him. This confeſſion doth Chriſt therefore require of ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him, and ownes no believing unto ſalvation in his new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, once confirmed by his death, where this is refuſed. For the benefits of Chriſt as Mediatour, and his adminiſtration, and the ſtate, order, and rules of that Teſtament whereof he is Mediator, and the ſubjects partaking of thoſe benefits, goe together in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of Scripture; ſo that if there be no baptizing into Chriſt, then is there not confeſſion of Chriſt, according to his appointment, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.30. And if not confeſſion of Chriſt, according to his appointment, then no faith to ſalvation by Chriſt expreſly owned, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.32, 33. with 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.2, 3. <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.42, 43. This I ſpeake in reference to the expreſſe word of God, which ought to be every mans rule to trie his way and walke by, becauſe by the Word he ſhall be tryed, and judged, juſtified, or condemned, according as he appeares by the ſame, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.48. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.16.</p>
            <p>This makes againſt the free grace of God,<note place="margin">Object. <hi>17.</hi>
               </note> that ſaves man, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any condition of obedience, or reſpect to any outward exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Ordinance, but onely to Chriſt, and believing in him.</p>
            <p n="1">1.<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> The truth aforeſaid no way oppoſeth Gods free grace in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving man through faith in Chriſt; for it brings nothing in with Chriſt to ſave any man, but lays out the way that God brings per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons into, whom he doth ſave. For they come not into that way of profeſſion to be ſaved, but being ſaved they come to ſhew their thankfulneſſe to God for the ſame.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This order of truth diſcovers and ſets out the true nature of Grace in its proper place, and uſe. Gods electing and chuſing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to ſalvation is of his free Grace, but whom he ſo chuſeth, he
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:113580:19"/>chuſeth in Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. Therefore to make Chriſt effentiall to mans ſalvation, is not againſt grace, but for it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The gift of Chriſt, and life by him, is free grace; but neither Chriſt, nor life by him is given without faith. Therefore to make believing in Jeſus Chriſt of abſolute neceſſitie to life, is not againſt grace, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8. Faith it ſelfe is the free gift of God, and the work of grace in the heart of man, yet is there no faith approved by God in his Word without workes, <hi>James</hi> 2. Therefore to put faith to tryall by its workes, and to bring both to the light, to try and to ſee if it be indeed that which God of his grace hath given to man for life, and the manifeſtation thereof, and to make them both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable companions, is no way againſt the free grace of god, that ſaves not man without faith, nor approves of faith without works, and tryes all workes by his Word.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The foreſaid truth confirmes grace, or faith in grace, by hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth from the Scriptures the priviledges that belong unto ſuch as believe through grace, and the freedome thereof in grace to faith alone, without any other condition at all. As the gracious new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant it ſelfe is free, which comprehends all that is between God and man in grace, and requires nothing but onely faith in Jeſus Chriſt to admit perſons into the ſame, which makes them one with all that the ſaid Covenant containes; whether ſtate, order, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, adminiſtrations, adminiſtrators, things adminiſtred, or to be adminiſtred, things paſt, preſent, or to come. All is theirs who are in the Covenant of grace, that contains all. And none are in the way of life held forth in the word of God, that are out of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. And all priviledges and benefits comprehended in the ſaid Covenant, lie all as free without conditions unto ſuch as believe, as the Covenant it ſelfe. For the Covenant in generall compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends the ſeverall parts in particular: and therefore looke what condition any one part lies under, the ſame doth another, and ſo all. If one part be free, all is free, and ſo indeed it is a free Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to ſuch as believe. And all the particular branches of this gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Covenant are ſo inſeparably joyned together, that if a man be truly under any one part, he is under all: if he have Chriſt, he hath all: if he have faith, he hath all: if he have one promiſe truly, he hath all: and if he have right to any one ordinance, he hath the ſame right to all. So that he that diſ-inherits himſelfe of any one
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:113580:19"/>part, diſ-inherits himſelfe of all. For grace in the Covenant, and the priviledges therein contained are not divided. And when faith finds the treaſure, ſhee will have alſo the field, where the treaſure is hid, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.44. Thus joyning of faith in Chriſt, and ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to Chriſt inſeparably together, as the Scriptures doe, (both being branches of one and the ſame gracious Covenant) doth no way oppoſe Gods free grace in ſaving man by faith in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>If the adminiſtrations of the new Teſtament lie ſo open and free to all that believe,<note place="margin">Object. <hi>18.</hi>
               </note> without condition or exception, then any that believe may adminiſter all Ordinances; and ſo women, as well as any other.</p>
            <p>By pretended abſurdities and falſe conſequences,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> the truth of God is commonly oppoſed and obſcured by the adverſaries there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: yet truth never brings upon it ſelfe any abſurdity. But abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſometimes ſeeme to follow through the ſubtilty of men oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the truth; and ſometimes through the ignorance of men, not knowing how to avoyd them, and defend the truth from them.</p>
            <p>Truth alwayes lyes within the bounds of order, whither true faith brings in a man, and there truth makes him free, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.32. Truth and order are never apart, much leſſe oppoſe each other, how ever men conceive: for God who is one, is the God both of truth, and of order, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. So that whereſoever faith findes truth, there order alſo dwells. For as God is the God of order, ſo his Word which is truth, is the rule of order; and this Word is faiths foundation, whereon ſhee builds: which Word is ſo farre from being any exceptive condition of truth, as that it is truth it ſelfe. God calls no man to diſpenſe his truth, whom he doth not fit and enable for the ſame: and whom God doth call and ſend, he ſo ſends them that they goe in faith. And faith ever attends at wiſdomes gate, and bids not goe otherwayes then Chriſt directs. So farre is faith from leading any to any abſurdity and diſorder, that it keepes them in the hand of truth, which guides them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to order, and reproves the contrary.</p>
            <p>And for womens adminiſtring of Ordinances; Gods free love and true faith never admits or gives way unto any unlawfull or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly libertie. And I have endeavoured to prove that the free uſe of ordinances is only to faith, not to the fleſh, and ſo not in any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly way. God who is the God of order, hath in his Word of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:113580:20"/>truth taught women what their dutie is: and namely in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.34, 35. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.11, 12. This rule forbids unto them the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring of ordinances. And they which have faith, will believe the Lord, and obey his Word.</p>
            <p>Againe, I have not ſaid, that the adminiſtrations of the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament are free for any that believe to adminiſter them. But I have proved that they are free for all that believe to ſubmit unto them (or rather, to Chriſt in them,) without any condition or exception againſt the ſame. Therefore it is ſtill the duty of all that believe in Jeſus Chriſts, as aforeſaid, to hold forth a confeſſion of this their believing in him, by their profeſſed ſubjection to him in the order and rules of his Teſtament, without which he doth not expreſly owne any faith in men according to the tenour of the ſaid Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid,<note place="margin">Object. <hi>19.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.14. <hi>That heaven departed, &amp;c.</hi> Which muſt be underſtood of the Church and Ordinances, and wee doe not finde when ſhee appeared in the like manner againe.</p>
            <p>That this muſt neceſſarily be underſtood of a departing of the Church and ordinances,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> is not ſo certaine as is imagined. See the like prophecy in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 34.4. and note well what went before in <hi>ver.</hi> 2,3. and what followes in <hi>verſ.</hi> 5, 6. — 11. and then conſider whether <hi>Iſaiab</hi> did there prophecy of ſuch a departure of the Church and Ordinances, as is now ſpoken of. That departing of heaven as a ſcroll, ſpoken of in <hi>Revel.</hi> 6.14. ſhall then be when the Sunne becomes blacke as ſackcloth, and the Moone as bloud; when the ſtarres of heaven fall unto the earth, as figs from a fig-tree ſhaken with a mighty wind; when every mountaine and iſleland are moved out of their places; when the Kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich, and the chiefe Captains, and the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and every bondman, and every free-man hide themſelves in he dens, and in the rockes of the mountaines, &amp;c. ſee the place, <hi>viz. Revel,</hi> 6.12, 13, 14, 15, 16. And then judge whether it be certain that this prophecy is fulfilled, and the heavens departing as a ſcroll is a departing of the Church and Ordinances.</p>
            <p>But let this ſeeme as granted for the preſent; (becauſe heaven in this Booke of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> doth ſometimes ſignifie the Church:) But then alſo minde that the Churches departing is here ſet forth by the ſimilitude of a booke or ſcroll folded together, which before
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:113580:20"/>lay open. So then the Church ſometimes lay open in her glory, and her light did ſhine abroad among the Nations; but now when that great oppoſition and perſecution did riſe againſt her, ſhee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired her ſelfe in a more private way. A booke or ſcroll is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced nor deſtroyed when it is rolled up together, but is as perfect in it ſelfe as before, onely it lies not ſo open for every one to looke into: and ſo it is with the Church, her departing is not from being a Church, but in reſpect of her obſcuring and hiding of her ſelfe from her enemies, as <hi>Iſai.</hi> 26.20. <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.6.14. For ſhee onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted as a ſcroll when it is rolled together, and ſo continued in her ſelfe a Church, enjoying (as her right) here ordinances and her communion ſtill. For in the next Chapter, there is the Lord upon his throne, with his Church &amp; Miniſtery about him worſhipping. The Church then here departed (as is aforeſaid) from her enemies, together with her Ordinances, to a more retired and obſcure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition then before but never departed from her ſelfe.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid,<note place="margin">Object. <hi>20.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.8. <hi>That the Temple was filled with ſmoke from the glory of god, and from his power, and no man was able to enter into the Temple, till the ſeven plagues of the ſeven Angels were fulfilled;</hi> Whence it is gathered, that in the time of Antichriſt, and the Beaſts reigne, there is no entring into any Church-order, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Conſider whether it be not a manifeſt property of an erring ſpirit,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> to wave cleare places of the Scripture, calling for the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall uſe of the Ordinances of Baptiſme, and the Lords Supper; as <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. and other like places: and to chuſe to walke in the darke, retiring to obſcure places (not yet underſtood) for a ſeeming refuge.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider whether this place do not manifeſtly allude to that in 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.10, 11. and whether that place doe import that there was any ceſſation of Ordinances in <hi>Solomons</hi> time.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Take notice that this place in <hi>Revel.</hi> 15. doth hold forth unto us a Church, and a glorious one too. For here is a Temple out of which the ſeven Angels goe with their ſeven golden vials full of the wrath of God againſt Antichriſt, or the Beaſt. For this ſee <hi>Revel.</hi> 15.1.5, 6. <hi>Revel.</hi> 16.1. &amp;c. Are not theſe the Miniſters of Chriſt, which goe forth of the Temple, which is the Church of Chriſt? into which men muſt firſt come, or elſe they cannot goe out thence: for no man can be ſaid to goe out of a place that he never came in.</p>
            <pb n="32" facs="tcp:113580:21"/>
            <p>Thus this Scripture well conſidered, ſhews the weakneſſe of thoſe that take up the ſame to oppoſe the Saints fellowſhip now, and their confeſſion of Chriſt in their profeſſed ſubjection to his order of the new Teſtament. This text is ſo farre from keeping any backe, that it rather calls all that have faith to come, ſeeing Chriſt will have at this time (even under the reigne of Antichriſt) ſuch a Church, out of which God will raiſe ſuch notable inſtruments to encounter with his enemies.</p>
            <p>Though the Church lyes ſometimes low and obſcure, yet God at ſome times raiſeth her up againe. The Church is as the Temple, ſometime open, and ſometime ſhut: and as the Moone, ſometime at the full, and ſometime in her change: and as a wife, ſometime ſporting with her husband, (as <hi>Rebecca</hi> with <hi>Iſaac,</hi> Gen. 26.8.) and ſometime in travaile and paine: ſometime ſinging the ſong of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and the Lambe, and ſometime hanging her harpe upon the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes. And thus ſhee is made conformable unto Chriſt her head, who is ſometime is bloud, ſometime on his throne; ſometime in a cloud, and ſometime with his face ſhining as the Sunne; ſometime with a raine-bow on his head, and ſometime in the brightneſſe of his glory. Therefore although that truth doth not alwayes in like manner appeare, yet this frees not man from his obedience unto it when it appeares; but rather engageth him the more.</p>
            <p>Chriſt foretells of falſe Chriſts and falſe Prophets that ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe and deceive many,<note place="margin">Object. <hi>21.</hi>
               </note> ſaying, <hi>Lo here is Chriſt, or there,</hi> Matth. 24. And this is fulfilled in thoſe that attempt the worſhip of God ſome one way, and ſome another; and yet have miſſed the right way. And ſome perceiving their miſtake, have begun againe: and all for want of the infallible Spirit of God to lead them forth at the firſt. And as they failed before, even ſo they may doe againe.</p>
            <p n="1">1.<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> Chriſts words in <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. are an anſwer to a demand of his Diſciples concerning his coming, and the end of the world; ſee <hi>verſ.</hi> 3, 4. And Chriſt doth not anſwer concerning his coming in the miniſtery of the Goſpel and adminiſtration of his Ordinances; for therein he came not in ſuch a manner as he ſpeakes of in this Chapter: ſee <hi>verſ.</hi> 27.30.

            <p n="2">2. The falſe Chriſts and falſe Prophets that Chriſt here fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warnes the faithfull to take heed of, are ſuch as ſhall ſhew great ſignes and wonders, <hi>ver.</hi> 24. How then comes it to paſſe, that they which hold forth the Goſpel and Ordinances of Chriſt, are cloſely inſinuated to be theſe falſe Prophets, whiles this is one maine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception againſt them, That they do not ſhew great ſignes and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders? Surely they prepare men to be deceived by theſe falſe Chriſts, and falſe Prophets, who teach men to receive none as Miniſters of Chriſt, though they prove their doctrine and way by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures never ſo clearly, unleſſe they ſhew great ſignes and wonders, and confirme their word and way thereby.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The falſe Prophets here ſpoken of, are ſuch as ſhall falſly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme themſelves to be ſuch Prophets as the Prophets of the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, <hi>Iſaiah, Jeremiah,</hi> and the reſt, were in their time; and as <hi>Agabus</hi> and ſome others were in the Apoſtles time. And the falſe Chriſts here ſpoken of, are ſuch as ſhall falſly affirme themſelves to be Chriſt in perſon; as appeares in <hi>verſ.</hi> 5.

            <p n="4">4. As in the next Chapter Chriſt teacheth his ſervants not to hide their talents in the earth, but to trade with the ſame; that is, to uſe their gifts to the gathering of the Elect, and the Churches edification; in which uſe their gifts alſo ſhall be encreaſed: ſo in <hi>Mark.</hi> 13. which is the ſame in effect with this preſent Chapter, he mindeth his ſervants, not onely to watch that they may not be found ſleeping, <hi>verſ.</hi> 35, 36. but alſo to conſider the authoritie that he hath given unto them, and the worke that he hath appointed them, <hi>verſ.</hi> 34. which muſt be underſtood of a miniſteriall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and a worke of the Miniſtry, to continue till his coming. And in this Chap. <hi>verſ.</hi> 45, 46. he minds them to give unto his houſhold their meat in due ſeaſon; which houſhold muſt needs be his Church; and their meat, his Word and Ordinances.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Doe not they in ſome ſort affirme Chriſt to be in the deſert, and in ſecret chambers, who affirme the Church to be in ſuch a ſort in the Wilderneſſe, as that there is now no place for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Miniſtry of the Goſpel, and Goſpel Ordinances?</p>
            <p n="6">6. As touching the want of an infallible ſpirit to lead men forth into all truth; It is true indeed that not onely all true and faithfull
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:113580:22"/>Preachers of the Goſpel, but alſo all true believers have an uncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the holy One, and know all things, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.20. But this is meant onely of ſome meaſure of knowledge, for true believers muſt ſtill grow in knowledge, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.20. And it is meant onely of their knowing all thoſe things, the knowledge whereof is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſalvation. As touching other things, the Spirit of truth doth not leade the Saints into all truth at once. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> and the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was defective in the underſtanding of the extent of Chriſts Commiſſion touching the preaching of the Goſpel to thoſe Gentiles that were not Proſelytes, untill God did further informe them. This appeares in <hi>Acts</hi> 10.10—15, 19, 20, 28.34. <hi>Acts</hi> 11.2—18. yet was <hi>Peter</hi> a true Apoſtle, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> a true Church. Yea it appeares that the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren which propheſied in conſtituted Churches were not free from all poſſibilitie of miſtaking. Note well, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.29. and 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.20, 21, 22. <hi>David</hi> and all <hi>Iſrael</hi> with him did miſtake, when they carried the arke of God in a Cart, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13. And were afterward ſenſible of their miſtake, and reformed it, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. yet <hi>David</hi> was the faithfull ſervant of God, the Prieſts were the Prieſts of the Lord, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> was his people: and God did not reprove their endeavour to bring up the arke to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> though he made a breach upon them at the firſt, becauſe they ſought him not after the due order. Therefore mens miſtaking the truth in ſome things, doth not make voyd that truth which they have: neither ſhould men forbeare to receive truth, till they can infallibly receive all at once. Although even godly men be not infallible, yet the rule of Gods written word, according to which the Saints are to walke, and to judge of wayes and Doctrines, is an infallible rule.</p>
            <p>To prevent ſome further objections, &amp; to make the anſwers more full to ſome objections already minded, conſider how the veſſells of the houſe of the Lord being cut in pieces, the doores of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhut up, the Lampes put out, and the burning of incenſe and offering burnt offerings in the holy place unto the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quite let fall in the dayes of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.24. and 29.6, 7.) in the dayes of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> the Prieſts and Levites being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged and commanded by the King, renewed and reſtored the ſolemne worſhip of God; their authoritie for the doing of this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not from any worker of miracles, or extraordinary Prophet in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:113580:22"/>that time, though the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was then living; but from the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Word of God by the Prophets that were in <hi>Davids</hi> dayes, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.25. So <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and the <hi>Jewes</hi> in his time erecting againe at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> firſt the Altar, and after that the Temple, and ſo reſtoring there Gods appointed worſhip, had not their authoritie from miracles or extraordinary Prophets then raiſed up, nor from any Prieſt that then ſtood up with Urim and Thummim, (ſee <hi>Ezra</hi> 2.63.) but from the Scriptures before written. <hi>Haggai</hi> and <hi>Zechariah</hi> did indeed prophecy unto them; but they did not firſt give unto them their Commiſſion and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, but did reprove them for their ſlackneſſe, and encourage them in the worke; (ſee <hi>Ezra</hi> 4.24. and 5.1.) ſharply reproving thoſe that ſaid then, as ſome doe now, <hi>The time is not come that the Lords houſe ſhould be built,</hi> Haggai 1.2. The like is to be noted concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reſtoring of the right obſervation of the feaſt of Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, which had been intermitted from <hi>Joſhuahs</hi> time; ſee <hi>Nehem.</hi> 8.13.—17. If queſtion be yet made whether the Saints have now authoritie to reſtore the ſolemne worſhip of God appointed in his Word for the time of the Goſpel, then mind that they are a royall Prieſthood, an holy Nation, a peculiar people, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. And that as <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> was greater then the Prophets that were before him, ſo he that is leaſt in the kingdome of heaven, is greater then <hi>John,</hi> Mat. 11.9.11.</p>
            <p>Here alſo let it be conſidered, that though all the labour of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi> ſeemed to fall to the ground in the dayes of <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> and <hi>Amon,</hi> and all the labour of <hi>Joſiah</hi> ſeemed to be loſt in the dayes of his ſonnes, and in the time of the captivitie, yet God looked not upon it as a loſt labour. And though after the captivitie the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings were ſlow, being retarded by many difficulties and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions, yet the rebuilding of the Altar and Temple, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring of the ſolemne inſtituted worſhip, was pleaſing to God, and profitable to his people; notwithſtanding that many of the <hi>Jewes</hi> did fall off unto unjuſt and irreligious practiſes; and many ſtayed ſtill in the territories of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and did not come to aſſiſt in that building: yea though the glory of the ſecond Temple was farre ſhort of the glory of <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple, and there ſtood not up at that time any Prieſt with Urim and Thummim. This well conſidered, will eaſily anſwer many objections that are now made
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:113580:23"/>againſt thoſe that have laboured, and ſtill labour, to revive the uſe of Chriſts Ordinances, and to ſet up againe his pure inſtituted worſhip.</p>
            <p>If many baptized perſons doe now fall to errours, and ſome to irregular practiſes, and there be among them ſuch diviſions as ought not to be; even ſo alſo it was in the Apoſtles dayes: yet no godly perſon will hereupon condemne the gathering of Churches, and the uſe of Chriſts Ordinances in thoſe dayes. And if ſome godly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have not had like experience with others, of Gods effectuall bleſſing following the uſe of the Ordinances, it may partly be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to ſome weakneſſe of their ſaith, and partly to their aſcribing to the Ordinance, ſomewhat belonging onely to Chriſt. And ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times God here tryes his children, whether they will live by faith, and waite on him in obedience, even againſt preſent ſenſe. And ſome Saints have had experience ſometimes of the like deadneſſe in and after prayer, and hearing, and conference: yet theſe things are neither to be reſuſed, nor neglected.</p>
            <p>Let it alſo be minded that the ſame ſalſe principles whereby men are now taken off from obedience to Chriſt in the uſe of his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, if they be followed home, will alſo take men off from obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to all Chriſts commands: for upon what ground any one command of Chriſt may be diſobeyed, upon the ſame all may be diſobeyed; ſee 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.21. And if the authoritie of Chriſts new Teſtament be weakened in one thing, it is weakened in all. To come to particulars. The ſame principles will take men off from preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel, and from hearing the Goſpel preached to be edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied thereby, and from aſſembling themſelves together, and from joyning together in prayer and thankſgiving; yea from meditation and ſtudie of the Word of God: for all theſe are Ordinances of Chriſt, and are no more appointed in the Word for theſe times, then Baptiſme and the Lords Supper.</p>
            <p>Many that receive not theſe Ordinances,<note place="margin">Object.</note> yet doe not reſuſe all Goſpel-preaching, conference, prayer, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="1">1.<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> This ſhewes that they are not conſtant to their principles, which diſcovers their great weakneſſe to receive ſuch principles as they may not in all things walke up unto.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Though they doe not yet reſuſe theſe things, yet are they in the ready way to the refuſall of them.</p>
            <pb n="37" facs="tcp:113580:23"/>
            <p>Minde alſo that as theſe principles carry men to the denying of a Church and Miniſtry, (which deniall is moſt contrary to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; ſee <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.21. and almoſt the whole Booke of the <hi>Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> and the promiſe in <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.18. and 28.20) ſo they carry them by degrees to the rejecting of all the Scripture, and to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying of faith and ſalvation; as lamentable experience hath ſhewed in ſome. And ſome upon the aforeſaid principles have (with as much eaſe and as faire a colour, as the no-Church-men diſpute from any Scriptures againſt Ordinances, though with as groſſe fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laciouſneſſe) hitherto wreſted our Saviours words in <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.17, 18. The anſwer whereunto doth fully overthrow the maine argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the oppoſers againſt Ordinances. Indeed if any one of thoſe three witneſſes in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.8. were to be excluded and ſligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, then were they all to be in like manner ſlighted, and ſo all were loſt. But we know that they are all to be regarded and made uſe of.</p>
            <p>It is alſo obſervable by what contrary wayes the enemy endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to make men refuſe the right uſe of Chriſts Ordinances. Sometimes he perſwades men that Gods people are not yet fit for the uſe of theſe Ordinances, becauſe their light is ſo dim; becauſe they have ſo ſmall a meaſure of gifts, of knowledge, of faith, &amp;c. And ſometimes againe he perſwades men that they are above ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. He might as well tell them that they are above Jeſus Chriſt, who commands the uſe of his Ordinances, and communicates him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe unto his in his Ordinances. Thus any thing ſhall ſerve the turne, whereby believers may be diverted from the right uſe of the Ordinances of their Lord and Maſter, and from obedience unto him. Surely the enemy is mindfull of the great advantage that he thus gets over believers, and how much he makes them herein to ſin againſt Chriſt, robbing him, what in them lyes, of the glorie, and themſelves of the comfort and benefit of his Mediatorſhip. O that the Saints were more ſenſible of the depth of this myſterie of iniquitie! I am conſtrained in my conſcience now to ſpeake with earneſtneſſe, conceiving the cauſe to be great; and remembring our dutie to contend earneſtly for the faith, which was once delivered to the Saints, <hi>Jude</hi> 3. (Where I deſire that the force of this word <hi>once,</hi> may well be weighed.) I therefore adviſe, and earneſtly exhort all them that believe, to beware of thoſe doctrines and wayes
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:113580:24"/>(how faire ſoever they may ſeeme to be before they be tryed, and what ſafety ſoever in theſe times of trouble they ſeeme to promiſe;) which indeed take men off from obedience to Chriſt, and from ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging the authoritie of the Scripture. Have no fellowſhip with what Doctrine which weakens and queſtions the power and authoritie of Jeſus Chriſt, and the perpetuall validitie of his Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which diſarmes his Souldiers, disbands his armies, and ſo gives them up into the hand of the enemy; which empties mens hearts of faith, and deprives the world of the appointed meanes of ſalvation, teaching men to ſhut up the kingdome of heaven. Beware of that doctrine which making voyd the authoritie of the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, pulls Chriſts Scepter out of his hand, his crowne from his head, and himſelfe from his throne. Remember that the Saints in their communion and order, are the Lords portion, the declared object of his love in Chriſt, and the expreſſed ſubject of his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and bleſſings: yea they are Chriſts relative perfection, as a wife is to her husband, and the body to the head. They are his prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling armie againſt Antichriſt; the Standard-bearer to hold him up before the Nations, and ſo the meanes of the worlds conviction, and the converſion of the reſt of the elect. You therefore that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt for ſalvation, hold forth the confeſſion of him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men. Remember that by him you are made the ſons of God, and Kings and Prieſts unto God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Revel.</hi> 5.10. Withhold not your ſelves then from worſhipping God, and enjoying the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed priviledges of ſons. Feare not, but believe: for you being Chriſts, all things are yours; and have you not then a right to his Ordinances? Remember Chriſts love in giving you his Ordinances to confirme your faith. Remember the need that you have of theſe Ordinances, and of that effectuall bleſſing with which Chriſt uſeth to follow the right uſe of his Ordinances. Minde your communion with Chriſt, and ſo be not ſlow to have communion with him in his Ordinances. Have fellowſhip with us; for truly our fellowſhip is with the Father, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt. But ſpecially mind the command of Chriſt, and that charge of his in <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.15. <hi>If yee love me, keepe my Commandements.</hi>

            <head>THE PECULIAR INTEREST OF THE ELECT IN CHRIST, AND HIS SAVING GRACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Now come to the ſecond Queſtion; viz. <hi>How farre the death of Chriſt extended to the taking away the ſin of man; whether he dyed for the ſins of all men without exception, or for the ſins of ſome onely.</hi> My anſwer hereunto I lay downe in theſe three Propoſitions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Chriſt hath not by his death taken away the ſinnes of all men: for the wrath of God comes upon the children of diſobedience for their ſinnes, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.6. But this is that which he declares himſelfe to have effected by his death, That through his Name, whoſoever believeth in him, ſhall receive remiſſion of ſinnes, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.14, 15, 16. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.43. And it is given to the Elect, and to them onely, to believe in Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Chriſt intended not by his death to ſave all men from their ſinnes, but thus to ſave the Elect onely, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.15. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.25, 26, 27. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 3.15. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.8.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Chriſt hath not preſented unto his Fathers juſtice a ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the ſinnes of all men; but onely for the ſinnes of thoſe that doe, or ſhall believe in him; (which are his Elect onely.) <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.9. And if this laſt Propoſition be granted to be true, the two former cannot be queſtioned. This therefore I thus confirme.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thoſe ſinnes for which Chriſt hath preſented a ſatisfaction to his Fathers juſtice, he hath ſo fully ſatisſied for, that they are
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:113580:25"/>not to be ſuffered for againe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.26. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.10.14. <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.9, 10. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.5. <hi>Levit.</hi> 17.11. It muſt needs be thus: 1. Becauſe the ſatisfaction that Chriſt hath preſented to his Fathers juſtice, is ſufficient for the full and finall putting away of all their ſins, for whom it is preſented. This cannot be denyed. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt dyed as a publique perſon, repreſenting all thoſe for whoſe ſins he preſented a ſatisfaction to his Fathers juſtice, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. Even as the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> fell as a publick perſon, repreſenting all thoſe that fell by him, and in him; ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.14. And as the high Prieſt went into the Holy place as a publick perſon, repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all <hi>Iſrael, Exod.</hi> 28.29, 30. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.24, 25. Hence it is that wee are looked upon as ſmitten in Chriſt, and buried with Chriſt, and revived and raiſed up in Chriſt, and with Chriſt, and made to ſit together in heavenly places in Chriſt; ſee <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.1, 2. with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.3, 4. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.5, 6. Now ſurely they who were thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by Chriſt, when he preſented to his Fathers juſtice a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for their ſinnes, ſhall not themſelves be puniſhed for the ſame ſinnes. 3. Becauſe elſe the ſatisfaction preſented by Chriſt, would fall ſhort of the type of it, <hi>Levit.</hi> 4.20.26.35. and 5.10. and note <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.13, 14. 4. Becauſe this ſatisfaction is accepted of the Father for all thoſe for whom it is preſented by Chriſt, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.10. For Chriſt the beloved Son of the Father preſented this ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction according to his Fathers will. 5. Becauſe it were an unjuſt and unreaſonable thing that God ſhould receive a ſatisfaction pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to his juſtice for the ſinnes of men, and yet puniſh the ſame men for the ſame ſinnes. And ſhall not the Judge of all the earth doe right? <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.25. But Reprobates (or finall unbelievers) ſhall ſuffer eternally for all their ſinnes; as appeares not onely in <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 6. but alſo in <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.36. <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.24. <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.36. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.14. <hi>Jude</hi> 15. Yea, for their ſins conſidered as breaches of the Law, as appeares in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9, 10. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. Therefore Chriſt preſented not unto his Fathers juſtice a ſatisfaction for the ſins of Reprobates, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently not for the ſins of all men.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Chriſt preſenting to his Fathers juſtice a ſatisfaction for mens ſinnes, preſents this ſatisfaction as well for all their ſinnes, as for any of their ſinnes; as well for their ſin of unbeliefe, and the fruits thereof, as for their ſinnes againſt the Law, conſidered as ſinnes againſt the Law, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16.21, 22. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.14. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:113580:25"/>But even by our adverſaries own confeſſion, it is a cleare and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine truth, that Chriſt hath not preſented to his Fathers juſtice a ſatisfaction for the unbeliefe of Reprobates, nor for the fruits of their unbeliefe, conſidered as fruits of their unbeliefe. Therefore he hath not preſented to his Fathers juſtice a ſatisfaction for any of the ſinnes of any Reprobates. The anſwer of our adverſaries here, and the principall refuge to which they fly, is this: Chriſt (ſay they) hath not preſented to his Fathers juſtice a ſatisfaction for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe of any. But the falſhood of this appeares by the places now alledged: as I ſhall alſo eaſily manifeſt, if our adverſaries will anſwer directly whether our unbeliefe be a ſin, or not. I conceive they dare not ſay it is no ſin, in as much as it is diſobedience againſt the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and againſt the command of God in <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.5. and that whereby (ſo farre as it workes in us) we caſt upon God the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of lying, truſting him no more then wee would truſt a lyer, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.10. and our adverſaries affirme it to be the onely damning ſinne. Now if it be a ſin, the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt doth waſh us from it, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7. I further demand; Is our unbeliefe remitted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, or not? If it be not remitted unto us, our caſe is moſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. If it be remitted unto us, it is then done away by the bloud of Chriſt: for without ſhedding of bloud is no remiſſion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.22. Whereas ſome ſay, that we have already ſuffered puniſhment for it in the want of that comfort and joy that faith brings; I demand; Doth our ſin of unbeliefe deſerve no other puniſhment? If they ſay, No: it ſhews that they neither know the nature of this ſin, and its ill deſerving; neither yet the glorious righteouſneſſe of God, and the declaration thereof in his Word. But if they ſay; yea, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves eternall deſtruction; but for all that it is neither remitted unto us with the reſt of our ſins, as being waſhed away by the bloud of Chriſt, neither ſhall we be ſo puniſhed for it: then they will be found to utter manifeſt contradictions. Whereas they plead that our unbeliefe doth not continue, but is broken off; I anſwer Indeed it doth not continue in the reigne of it: but it is enough that it did once reigne in us, and that there is a remainder of unbeliefe ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling in us. And the ſame (and no more) is to be ſaid of the reſt of our fins and corruptions alſo: for which notwithſtanding wee muſt have been puniſhed with everlaſting deſcruction, if the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt ſhed for us for the remiſſion of ſinnes, did not clenſe
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:113580:26"/>us from the ſame. Whereas they object that there could not have been that unbeliefe whereby the Goſpel is refuſed, if Chriſt had not dyed that he might ſend forth his Goſpel; and that therefore this unbeliefe could not be looked upon before the death of Chriſt, and the declaration of his Goſpel. I anſwer; 1. That Chriſt foreſeeing this ſin (as he did all other ſinnes) and all the fruits thereof, in his Elect, did accordingly provide a remedy for the ſame: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes he had not been unto them a perfect and effectuall Saviour. 2. That the condemnatory ſentence of the Law, takes hold on men for this ſin alſo, and for all the fruits of it; becauſe it binds men to obey every command that God ſhall give, and to believe every word that he ſhall ſpeake: without which obeying and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, no man can have the Lord for his God, according to the meaning of the affirmative part of the firſt Commandement. Therefore Chriſt had not taken us off from the Lawes condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if he had not preſented to his Fathers juſtice a ſatisfaction for this our ſin, as well as for our other ſinnes.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Paſſeover (a type of Chriſt) was not killed for any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed, but onely for the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and thoſe that were joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. Neither were the Prieſts to offer ſacrifice for any other. All this was appointed of God to ſignifie, that when the Meſſiah through the eternall Spirit ſhould offer himſelfe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpot to God, he ſhould preſent unto divine juſtice a ſatisfaction for the ſinnes of the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, and none other.</p>
            <p>Whereas it is objected, that many of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> for whom the Paſſeover was killed, and ſacrifices were offered, were unbelievers and periſhed.</p>
            <p>I anſwer: So alſo the high Prieſt himſelfe might be an unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and periſh; yet in his Prieſtly office he was a type of Chriſt not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that diſparitie. So the whole Nation of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſeparated from the world to be a peculiar people unto God, were a type of Gods choſen <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. When Chriſt prayed unto his Father that they for whom he laid downe his life, might receive the benefit of the ſame; he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly affirmed that he prayed onely for the Elect, and for none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.9. Whereby he ſufficiently declared that he did not then preſent to his Fathers juſtice a ſatisfaction for the ſins of any other, but onely of theſe.</p>

            <p n="5">5. The higheſt degree of Gods love to man is ſet forth by his Sonnes being given, and giving himſelfe to dye for mens ſinnes, that ſo he might preſent to his Fathers juſtice a ſatisfaction for their ſinnes, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.11.15. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.12, 13. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. and 4.9, 10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8. If then we ſhall ſay, that Chriſt in his death preſented to his Fathers juſtice a ſatisfaction for the ſinnes of all men, we ſhall be found to extend the higheſt and choiceſt love of God as well to hated <hi>Eſau,</hi> as to beloved <hi>Jacob;</hi> as well to the ſeed of the Serpent, as to the ſeed of Chriſt: which doctrine the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will not endure.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The whole doctrine of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt being deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered unto us in the Scriptures, it is a ſufficient ground for us not to believe that Chriſt preſented to his Fathers juſtice a ſatisfaction for the ſinnes of all men, becauſe the Scriptures doe no where de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare this to be a truth; as (through the helpe of God) ſhall be made to appeare by our anſwers to the objections of our adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. For the more eaſie diſcovery of the weakneſſe of which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, I lay downe theſe enſuing Propoſitions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The word <hi>All</hi> in Scripture, doth many times ſignifie onely ſome of all forts, as appeares in theſe places, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.23. <hi>Act.</hi> 10.12. <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.5, 6. In <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.23. it is ſaid that Chriſt healed <hi>every ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and every diſeaſe among the people;</hi> yet the meaning is onely this, That he healed every kind of ſickneſſe and diſeaſe: ſee <hi>Mark.</hi> 6.5. and <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.3. &amp;c. In <hi>Acts</hi> 10.12. it is ſaid,—<hi>wherein were all foure-footed beaſts, &amp;c.</hi> that is, All kinds of foure-footed beaſts, &amp;c. In <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.5, 6. it is ſaid, <hi>There went out to him all Judoaea,</hi> &amp;c. And in <hi>Mark.</hi> 1.5. it is alſo expreſly ſaid, that <hi>they were all baptized of him,</hi> &amp;c. Yet this was true onely of all orders and degrees of men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>John</hi> from all the parts of <hi>Judaea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The word <hi>All,</hi> muſt ſometimes be underſtood with limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto the preſent ſubject ſpoken of. As in <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.8.—<hi>whereof all are partakers;</hi> not all perſons, but onely all ſons.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The word <hi>All,</hi> doth ſometime ſignifie onely the greater part: as in <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.21. <hi>All ſeeke their owne,</hi> &amp;c. and in <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.26. <hi>Woe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you when all men ſhall ſpeake well of you.</hi> Here <hi>All</hi> cannot take in all the godly, but onely the wicked, which are the greater number. There was not this woe to that <hi>Demetrius</hi> which had a good report <hi>of all men,</hi> 3 <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. that is, of all godly men that knew him.</p>
            <pb n="44" facs="tcp:113580:27"/>
            <p n="4">4. The word <hi>World</hi> in like manner doth not alwayes ſignifie all perſons without exception; but ſometime onely the worſer, though greater part of mankinde; as in <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.9. where <hi>the world</hi> is put onely for perſons not elected. Yea, and when the word <hi>whole</hi> is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to it: as in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.19.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Sometimes the word <hi>World</hi> is put for the Gentiles oppoſed to the Jewes, yea and with manifeſt limitation unto thoſe of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles which did, or ſhould believe; (which were onely the Elect:) ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.12.15. Theſe Propoſitions being thus layd downe and proved, the anſwer to the objections will be the more eaſie and cleare.</p>
            <p>The objection that I will take notice of in the firſt place,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>1.</hi> Object.</note> is taken from <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.29. <hi>Behold the Lambe of God which taketh away the ſin of the world.</hi> Whereto I thus anſwer.</p>
            <p n="1">1.<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> Let this be minded, that Chriſt is here called the Lambe of God, as being typified by the Paſchall Lambe killed for <hi>Iſrael,</hi> not for the uncircumciſed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is here declared that it is Chriſt, and no other, that taketh away the ſin of the world. He is the onely Redeemer and Saviour. The Father ſaveth us no otherwayes but in and by Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The ſin which Chriſt takes away, is the ſin of the world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſin which is derived to us, and ſo to all the world, from <hi>Adam;</hi> and in which all the world hath layen. But the perſons from whom Chriſt takes away this ſin, are onely they that doe or ſhall believe in him; and ſo they are indeed that world ſpoken of in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.12.15. but not that world ſpoken of in <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.9. and 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.19. Our adverſaries confeſſe that Chriſt takes not away the unbeliefe of that world: and the Scriptures declare that world to have no part in the bleſſedneſſe of thoſe to whom the Lord will not impute ſin; ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.6, 7, 8.</p>
            <p>A ſecond objection is drawne from 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.2.—<hi>not for ours one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>2.</hi> Object.</note> 
               <hi>but alſo for the ſins of the whole world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My anſwer hereto is as followes:</p>
            <p n="1">1.<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> Note well the force of the word rendred <hi>propitiation,</hi> both is this verſe, and in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.10. As in theſe places it is uſed, it imports that Jeſus Chriſt makes the Father to be gracious unto us in the free and full pardon of our ſinnes. Here it is uſed to cleare and prove Jeſus Chriſt to be for us an acceptable and effectuall Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:113580:27"/>with the Father, though we have ſinned againſt him. And in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.10. the higheſt manifeſtation of the Fathers love unto us, is ſet forth by his giving his Son to be the propitiation for our ſins. This ſhews it to be the peculiar bleſſedneſſe of Gods beloved chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, whom he ſaves for ever, to have Jeſus Chriſt to be the propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation for their ſinnes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7.9. it is clearly ſignified that they onely are the perſons whom the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt doth clenſe from all ſin, and to whom the Father according to his faithfulneſſe doth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give their ſinnes, and whom be clenſeth from all unrighteouſneſſe, who ſhew their faith by walking in the light, and by confeſſing their ſinnes. This alſo confirmes that Jeſus Chriſt is the propitiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for their ſinnes onely.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By <hi>our ſinnes</hi> the Apoſtle here meant <hi>the ſinnes of us believing Jewes:</hi> (for to theſe the Apoſtle here immediately wrote; as may be gathered from 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.7. and <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.9. Yea all the generall E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plſtles, of which this was one, were written to theſe:) and by <hi>the ſins of the whole world,</hi> he meant the ſinnes of all thoſe that did or ſhould believe among the Gentiles: ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.15.</p>
            <p>The words of our Saviour in <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16, 17, 18, 19.<note place="margin">3. <hi>Object.</hi> From <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16, &amp;c.</note> are alſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected unto us, as if they made againſt us; wee will-therefore dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently conſider them.</p>
            <p>Here firſt were muſt minde that the ſame word is ſometimes uſed in divers ſenſes in the ſame ſentence;<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> examples hereof are to be ſeene in <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.6. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.21. and in other places. Yea this very word <hi>World,</hi> is ſo uſed in <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.10. And now let us ſee how this word is uſed in this Scripture, and conſider whether this Scripture do indeed make any thing againſt us; <hi>verſ.</hi> 16. <hi>God ſo loved the world.</hi> By the <hi>World</hi> here ſeemes to be meant mankinde in generall: and Gods loving the world in his dealing lovingly with the world. This then is the ſenſe; God dealt ſo lovingly with mankinde, <hi>that be gave his onely begotten Son, &amp;c.</hi> All this makes nothing againſt us: for it is not ſaid, that he gave his onely begotten Son to preſent a ſatisfaction to his juſtice for the ſins of all men: but <hi>that be gave his mely begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him, ſhould not periſh; but have eternall life.</hi> Herein ſurely God dealt lovingly with mankinde; 1. Making a great part of mankinde to receive the beneſie hereof. 2. Gracionſly ſending this Goſpel to mankind; <hi>Believe in the Son of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:113580:28"/>God, and yee ſhall be ſaved eternally.</hi> This Goſpel ſhews that God is gracious, and deales lovingly, though men left to themſelves reject this Goſpel, and ſo receive no benefit by it in the end. 3. Sparing mankind a long time, and affording unto them many benefits by the hand of Chriſt, for the Elects ſake, whiles he graciouſly waits and effectually provides for their converſion by the Goſpel, and ſo for their ſalvation according to the ſame. None of which benefits had been afforded to mankind, if God had not given his Son, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever believeth on him, ſhould not periſh; ſee <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.15, 16. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.22. <hi>Acts</hi> 14.17. Yet unbelievers ſtill lye under all their ſins, as I have already proved, and as farther appeares in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.22. and 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. It follows in <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. <hi>For God ſent not his Son into the world to condemne the world.</hi> God then ſent his Sonne into the world, when he gave him to be made fleſh, and to dwell among us, as it is ſaid of him in <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.14. Then he ſent him not to condemne the world, nor to judge the world; (as the Greeke word is ſaid here to ſignifie:) But at his ſecond coming he ſhall be ſent to judge the world, and to condemne all unbelievers. But the new doctrine of our adverſaries makes Chriſts firſt coming to be coming to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the world, in a ſenſe quite contrary to the Scriptures, whiles they teach, that if Chriſt had not come and dyed for all, none could have been damned.<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Den</hi> in his <hi>Dragnet.</hi> p. 85.</note> It follows; <hi>but that the world through him might be ſaved.</hi> 1. Here mind that the pleaſure of the Lord did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper in Chriſts hand, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 53.10. note alſo <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.38, 39, 40. and <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.2. Therefore Chriſt did certainly effect what he was ſent for. 2. Mind that the ſalvation here ſpoken of, frees men from all condemnatory judgement. This appeares by the antitheſis (or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition) in this verſe. 3. So mind that the world is ſaid to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, in that believers are ſaved, who are part of the world of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and were choſen out of the reſt of the world, to be ſaved by Chriſt; ſee alſo 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.14. compared with the verſes there afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going, <hi>viz. verſ.</hi> 9.—13. of that Chapter. Our adverſarles not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving this truth, doe ſometimes ſay, hat though all the world be not ſaved eternally, becauſe they believe not: yet Chriſt for his part did for them all, whatſoever he was to doe for the ſalvation of a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>. But if this were true, then all muſt needs be ſaved. See <hi>Jerem.</hi> 17.1. For our ſalvation is fully from Jeſus Chriſt. Wee cannot ſave our ſelves: neither doth the Father worke our ſalvation, or any thing
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:113580:28"/>that concernes the ſame, any other wayes then in and by his Sonne Chriſt. If then Chriſt as a Saviour have done for us whatſoever he is to doe for the ſalvation of any, how can wee miſſe of ſalvation? It follows herein <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. <hi>He that believeth on him, is not condemned: but he that believeth not, is condemned already, becauſe he hath not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,</hi> &amp;c. The believer is delivered from the condemnation of the Law. As for the unbeliever, becauſe he believeth not, he is left to the ſentence of the Law, and is already condemned thereby. All this is with us. It follows in <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. <hi>And this is the condemnation;</hi> that is, the cauſe of condemnation, as being a groſſe evill for which men are to be condemned, and a maine cauſe of that unbeliefe by which men are left to condemnation; <hi>That light is come into the world, &amp;c.</hi> that is; <hi>that light being come into the world, men loved darkneſſe rather then light.</hi> The light come into the world is Jeſus Chriſt held forth in his Goſpel. And all this oppoſeth us not, but confirmes the truth that we hold. Thus at the appearing of the light of truth, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection from this place is vaniſhed away.</p>
            <p>A fourth objection is drawne from 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4.6.<note place="margin">4. <hi>Object.</hi> From 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4.6. anſwered.</note> which to our adverſaries ſeemes to be of ſpeciall ſtrength.</p>
            <p>In the anſwering (or rather proventing) whereof we will through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſearch that place alſo, beginning at the beginning of that Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and weighing every thing diligently that may ſeeme to have any relation to the preſent Queſtion. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1. <hi>I exhort therefore, that firſt of all, ſupplications, prayers, interceſſions, and giving of thankes be made for all men.</hi> By <hi>all men</hi> in this place we may not underſtand all perſons, or every perſon without any exception or limitation. For under ſupplications, prayers, and interceſſions, are here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended all petitions for all good and needfull gifts and bleſſings for the perſons to be prayed for, put up unto God with all earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and fervency, in which the Petitioners will and muſt ſtill continue ſuing unto God with a holy and humble importunitie for thoſe things that they crave: ſuch Petitions cannot be made in faith for all perſons without exception, in as much as we know that there are many veſſells of wrath ordained of old unto condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.22. <hi>Jude</hi> 4. And there is a ſin unto death, for which we are not to pray, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.16. Therefore <hi>by all men</hi> we are here to underſtand all orders and degrees of men. And ſo the thing to be craved is, that God according to his purpoſe and gracious promiſes
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:113580:29"/>would ſhew mercy, and extend the fruits of his love too all orders and degrees of men; that is, to all thoſe whom he hath choſen to himſelfe out of every nation and kindred, and out of every order and degree of men and women in the world. This is further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by that ſpecification or exemplification which followes in <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. <hi>For Kings.</hi> Though theſe were before comprehended under <hi>all men,</hi> yet are they here more particularly expreſſed; 1. Leſt the Saints ſhould have been diſcouraged from praying for them, by their wickedneſſe. 2. Becauſe God hath given Magiſtrates to be his own Miniſters to us for good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.4. <hi>And for all that are in authoritie;</hi> that is to ſay; 1. Magiſtrates or Governours in thoſe Common-wealths that were not ruled by Kings. 2. The ſeverall orders and degrees of inferiour Magiſtrates. <hi>That wee may leade a quiet and peaceable life,</hi> &amp;c. Not that this is the onely thing that we are to crave, or aime at: but becauſe this ſhould in a ſpeciall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſtirre us up to earneſt prayer for Magiſtrates; <hi>viz.</hi> that God hath given them their authoritie to this end, that by meanes of this authoritie rightly uſed, we might leade a quiet and peaceable life in all godlineſſe and honeſty. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 3. <hi>For this is good and acceptable in the ſight of God our Saviour: viz.</hi> That we ſhould thus pray, and give thankes for all orders and degrees of men; and namely for Kings, and for all that are in authoritie. And note how the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle proves this in the words following in <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. <hi>Who will have all men to be ſaved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.</hi> In as much as it is the Apoſtles ſcope here to prove that it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God, not onely that we ſhould pray, but alſo that we ſhould give thankes for all men, (<hi>viz.</hi> in that ſenſe in which the words <hi>all men</hi> are uſed in <hi>verſ.</hi> 1.) I therefore conceive that he here ſpeakes of Gods effectuall will. And ſo God willeth not that all perſons, or every perſon in the world, ſhould be ſaved, and come unto the knowledge of the truth: as appeares in 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Jude</hi> 4. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 6.9, 10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.7, 8. Here therefore by <hi>all men</hi> wee muſt of neceſſitie underſtand onely all orders and degrees of men; that is, ſome of all orders and degrees: <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe whom God hath choſen to himſelfe out of every order and degree among men. Thus the great objection from this verſe is fully taken off. It follows in <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. <hi>For there is one God, and one Mediatour between God and men, the man Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Not one God of Kings, and another of ſubjects; one
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:113580:29"/>God of Merchants, another of husbandmen: but one and the ſame God is the God of all, that ſaveth all that are heires of ſalvation, of what order or degree ſoever they be. And as the ſame God hath appointed and conſtituted the ſeverall orders and degrees among men, ſo he hath his Elect whom he will ſave, among all thoſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and degrees. So alſo there is not one Mediatour between God and great men, and another between God and meane men: but the ſame Chriſt Jeſus is the Mediatour between God and all the Elect, of whatſoever order or degree among men they are.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Verſ.</hi> 6. <hi>Who gave himſelfe a ranſome for all.</hi> The word <hi>All</hi> muſt here be underſtood as in <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. and 4. Neither the coherence or context, neither yet the matter will ſuffer us to underſtand it otherwayes. For whoſoever they are for whom Chriſt gave himſelfe a ranſome, the ſame are certainly redeemed from deſtruction, and ſhall for ever be ſaved. For where a ranſome is paid and accepted for any, the ranſomed is thereby freed and made ſafe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.30. <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.12.-15. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.7. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.11, 12. And the everlaſting ſalvation of the ranſomed of the Lord is clearly held forth in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 35.9, 10. and 51.10, 11. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.14. with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.54, 55. Therefore theſe AB for whom Chriſt gave himſelfe a ranſome, are onely (as aforeſaid) men of all orders and degrees; even thoſe many ſpoken of in <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.28. <hi>Mark.</hi> 10.45. Thoſe whom Chriſt hath redeemed to God by his bloud out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Revel.</hi> 5.9. It follows; <hi>To be teſtified in due time;</hi> compare this with 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20, 21.—<hi>but was manifeſt in theſe laſt times for you, who by him doe believe,</hi> &amp;c. Conſider alſo how the words there aforego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doe declare, that they which are ranſomed or redeemed with the bloud of Chriſt, are redeemed from their vaine convenſation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18, 19. Yea Chriſt gave himſelfe for them, that he might redeeme them from all iniquitie, and purfie them unto himſelfe a peculiar people, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. And this is the ſumme of the goſpels teſtimony concerning Chriſt, that <hi>being made perfect be became the another of eternall ſalvation</hi> (not to all perſons in the world, but) <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all them that obey him,</hi> Heb. 5.9. having given himſelfe for them, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.25, 26. Thus this Scripture is ſo farre from being full and ſtrong againſt us, that it doth not oppoſe us in any thing. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canſe the objection from this Scripture ſeemes to our adverſaries to be backed and ſtrengthened by the ſaying of <hi>Peter</hi> in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:113580:30"/>therefore that place ſhall next be looked into.</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1.—<hi>There ſhall be falſe teachers among you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">5. <hi>Object.</hi> From 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1. anſwered.</note> 
               <hi>who privily ſhall bring in damnable hereſies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themſelves ſwift deſtruction.</hi> We grant the perſons here ſpoken of to be Reprobates; but minde that though the Lord be here ſaid to have bought them, yet it is not ſaid that he gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe <hi>a ranſome</hi> for them. Between theſe two there is a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. The Lord Chriſt hath authoritie and power given unto him of the Father over all men; ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.8, 9. Yea over all creatures, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.7, 8. over the Angels in heaven, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.22. And the Devils that hate him, are yet under his power. In the exerciſe of this power and authoritie, he ſhall at the laſt day judge all both men and Angels, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.27. <hi>Acts</hi> 17.31. Then every knee ſhall bow to him, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and every tongue ſhall confeſſe that Jeſus Chriſt is Lord, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 45.23 <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.9, 10, 11. This Lordſhip the man Chriſt hath obtalned by his death, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8, 9. In that by his death he hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his kingly power and authoritie over his Church, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently this power and authoritie over all, that as King of his Church he may uſe it to his Churches good, (<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.20, 21, 22, 23.) and the Church may enjoy the glorious benefit of it; ſee <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel.</hi> 2.26, 27. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2, 3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1 49.6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.27. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo being pleaſed thus to ſhew his gracious approving and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting of Chriſts dying for his Church, even by giving him this power and authoritie over all for his Churches good. In this ſenſe, and in this ſort Chriſt hath bought all creatures: yet it doth not follow, nor is it true, that Chriſt hath given himſelfe a ranſome for all creatures, or preſented to his Fathers juſtice a ſatisfaction for the ſinnes of all creatures. We are put in mind that the Lord ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving bought theſe ſinners, this was a great aggravation of their ſin in denying him. We acknowledge this to be true. But let it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered. 1. In what fort they did deny Chriſt. 2. How their being bought by Chriſt, was an aggravation of this their ſin. 1. They did not deny Chriſt openly, ſaying expreſly that Jeſus was not the Chriſt: for they brought in their damnable hereſies privily, and made merchandiſe of Chriſtians with fained words, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1.3. and were admitted to their love-feaſts, <hi>Jude</hi> 12. But their denying of him was like unto that which <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake of in <hi>Tis.</hi> 1.16. being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:113580:30"/>againſt his commands. 2. It was a great aggravation of their ſin of rebellion, that they denyed the Lord that bought them. 1. Becauſe Chriſt having bought them, had power and authoritie to command them: therefore they ought to have obeyed him, and not to have rebelled againſt him. 2. It was (for the preſent) very beneficiall unto them that Chriſt had ſo bought them. For Chriſt in the exerciſe of that power and dominion over the world, which by his death he hath obtained, conferres upon men all the benefits that they receive. It was therefore an aggravation of their ſin, that they did rebell againſt ſuch a benefactour. 3. Chriſt having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by his death this dominion over all, for the good of thoſe that believe in him, the conſideration of his being the Lord that hath ſo bought all, ſhould perſwade ſinners to believe in him. This therefore was an aggravation of their ſin of unbeliefe and diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. 4. Thus the Apoſtle did alſo reprove their madneſſe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling againſt the Lord that bought them, who therefore could not want power to puniſh them. Now although the Lord (in that ſenſe and in that ſort that we have taken notice of) hath bought theſe; yet will he truly ſay unto them in the day of judgement, <hi>I never knew you,</hi> Mat. 7.23.</p>
            <p>A ſixth objection is preſented to us from <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9.—<hi>That be by the gract of God ſhould taſte death for every man.</hi>
               <note place="margin">6. <hi>Object.</hi> From <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 9. anſwered.</note> Whereto I thus returne anſwer. 1. I deny not, but have already declared, that every man (without exception of any) doth in this life receive benefit by the death of Chriſt. And what Chriſt effecteth by his death, the ſame was intended both by the Father, and by Chriſt. 2. I am informed that the word <hi>man,</hi> is not here expreſſed in the Greeke Text, but ſupp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>yed by the tranſlators: Whereupon I would have it to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, whether they might not as well have ſupplyed the word <hi>Son,</hi> becauſe of that which follows in <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. <hi>For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many ſons unto glory, to make the Captain of their ſalvation perfect through ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings.</hi> 3. Though we here reade <hi>for every man;</hi> yet conſidering what here follows in <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. and what went before in <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Are they not all miniſtring ſpirits, ſent forth to miniſter for them, who ſhall be heires of ſalvation?</hi> I conceive by <hi>every man</hi> we may here underſtand onely <hi>every ſon;</hi> or (which is all one) every man that ſhall be an heire of ſalvation. This I am the more confirmed in by that which
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:113580:31"/>follows in <hi>verſ.</hi> 11.—17. where they for whoſe ſake Chriſt tooke part of fleſh and bloud, (and conſequently, for whoſe ſalvation he taſted death) are declared to be brethren of Chriſt, and children given to Chriſt of the Father. I am alſo the more confident of this, becauſe of theſe words <hi>by the grace of God</hi> in the place objected to us; it being certaine that the Elect, and onely they, are the object of that grace of God whereby wee are ſaved. Thus I can diſcerne no ſtrength at all in any objection to be made againſt us from this place.</p>
            <p>Some endeavour to make a ſeventh objection from 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10.<note place="margin">7. <hi>Object.</hi> From 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 4. 19. anſwered.</note> —<hi>we truſt in the living God, who is the Saviour of all man, ſpecially of them that believe.</hi> But the ſhewing of the true meaning of the place, may ſave them the labour of making their objection. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeakes of a twofold ſalvation. 1. A ſalvation temporall, of which you may reade in theſe places: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.8.10. <hi>Nebem.</hi> 9.17. <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.25. Touching this ſalvation, God is the Saviour of all men. Yea he preſerveth man and beaſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.6. 2. Eternall ſalvation. And this God hath prepared for his owne people, and for none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſaving them by his Son Jeſus Chriſt from ſin and eternall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. To theſe he gives to believe in Jeſus Chriſt, that they may be ſaved by him, according to the promiſe of the Goſpel. Thus he is the Saviour of all men, ſpecially of them that believe. And thus there remaines no objection to be made againſt us from this place.</p>
            <p>Another place from which an objection is made againſt us,<note place="margin">8. <hi>Object.</hi> From <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 29. anſwered.</note> is <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. <hi>Of bow much ſorer puniſhment ſuppoſe yee ſhall he be thought worthy, who hath troden under-foot the Son of God, and bath counted the bloud of the Covenant, wherewith he was ſanctified, an unholy thing,</hi> &amp;c. This is cleare that by the bloud of the Covenant is here meant the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt, which he himſelfe calls the bloud of the new Teſtament or Covenant, <hi>Mark.</hi> 14.24. But who is the perſon that is here ſaid to be <hi>ſanctified</hi> with this bloud? Our adverſaries ſay, The ſinner here ſpoken of. But his ſinner is not in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. He is not made partaker of Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.14. He is not ſprinkled with his bloud, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. How then is he ſanctified with his bloud? Thoſe that are ſanctified with this bloud of Chriſt, by one offering Chriſt hath perfected them for ever, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.14. Therefore they are ſaved eternally. It is not therefore the ſinner
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:113580:31"/>that periſheth, but Jeſus Chriſt himſelfe (ſpoken of by the name of the Son of God in the words immediately afore-going) who is here declared to have been ſanctified with this bloud. There is a ſanctifying of Chriſt ſpoken of in <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.36. That was the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſetting him apart to the office of Mediatour. That is not the ſanctifying here ſpoken of. But that you may rightly underſtand the ſanctifying here ſpoken of, you muſt remember that Chriſt did beare our ſinnes, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. Yea the Father did lay on him our iniquitie, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.6. And ſo he was made ſin for us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. Now that our ſin might neither returne upon us, nor ſtill lie upon him, it was neceſſary that he ſhould purge it away from himſelfe. This he did by himſelfe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. by his bloud, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.5. Doing this he ſanctified himſelfe with his own bloud: and had he not done this, he had not ſanctified us with his bloud as the Scriptures declare him to have done, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.12. Therefore when he was neare to his Paſſion, (in which he was to doe this worke) he ſaid to his Father concerning his Diſciples, <hi>For their ſakes</hi> (or, <hi>for them,</hi> as ſome underſtanding the Greeke tongue, doe ſay the words may be rendred; that is, for their good) <hi>I ſanctifie my ſelfe,</hi> Joh. 17.19. As this interpretation ſeemes to be genuine and proper, and no way forced, ſo it fully agrees with the Apoſtles ſcope, which was to hold forth the excellency of the bloud of Chriſt, that ſo he might alſo ſhew their odious ſin that count it an unholy thing. And the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the bloud of Chriſt could not be more clearly declared, then by ſhewing that Jeſus Chriſt when he was made ſin for us (all our ſinne then lying upon him) was ſanctified by his own bloud. Thus this Scripture being truly underſtood, and ſo made to agree with other Scriptures, makes nothing at all againſt us.</p>
            <p>The next place of Scripture objected to us by our adverſaries,<note place="margin">9. <hi>Object.</hi> From <hi>Heb.</hi>

                  </gap>.15. anſwer.</note> that we will now conſider, is <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15. from which they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to inferre that Chriſt hath freed all men from their ſinnes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the firſt Teſtament, and conſequently from their ſins againſt the Law, conſidered as ſinnes againſt the Law. And if Chriſt have freed all men from their ſinnes againſt the Law, conſidered as ſinnes againſt the Law, then he hath preſented to his Fathers juſtice a ſatisfaction for the ſinnes of all men. The words in that place of Scripture, are theſe; <hi>And for this cauſe he is the Mediatour of the new Teſtament, that by meanes of death, for the redemption of the tranſgreſſions
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:113580:32"/>that were under the firſt Teſtament, they which are called might receive the promiſe of eternall inheritance.</hi> Here theſe things are to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. 1. By the firſt Teſtament is not here meant any covenant made with <hi>Adam,</hi> or any Teſtament given to <hi>Adam</hi> before his fall; but the legall and typicall Covenant and Teſtament made with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and given to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in the dayes of <hi>Moſes:</hi> as appeares in the words following, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>verſ.</hi> 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. compared with <hi>Exod.</hi> 24.3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. ſee alſo <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.6, 7, 8, 9. 2. The Apoſtles ſcope here is to ſhew that the believing <hi>Jewes</hi> were freed from their ſinnes againſt the firſt Teſtament, not by the bloud of bulls and of goats, or any ſuch like thing offered according to the Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:</hi> but by the death of Chriſt. This appeares in this <hi>Chap.</hi> in <hi>verſ.</hi> 9.12.13. and in <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. <hi>verſ.</hi> 1.4, 5.8, 9, 10, 11. And here note by the way, that theſe words <hi>once for all</hi> in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.10. doe not ſignifie once for all men, as ſome have ignorantly conceived: but <hi>once and no more.</hi> 3. The reſtriction of this to believers appeares plainly in the words of the Scripture objected, if men had eyes to ſee it. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares likewiſe clearly in the verſe afore-going. Alſo in <hi>verſ.</hi> 24. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.25. Alſo in <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.25. Alſo in <hi>chap.</hi> 10.10.14, 15, 16, 17. And that unbelievers under the Law were not redeemed from their ſins againſt the Law, is manifeſt in <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.12. where it is ſaid, that <hi>they ſhall be judged by the Law.</hi> 4. As it hath been already proved<note n="*" place="margin">In <hi>pag.</hi> 40.</note> that all wicked perſons ſhall be condemned and puniſhed for all their wickedneſſe whatſoever, ſo I deſire our adverſaries to behold this truth againe in that glaſſe which is held forth unto them in <hi>Revel.</hi> 21.8. For that place doth not onely ſhew who ſhall be puniſhed with eternall torment, but alſo notes the evills for which they ſhall be ſo puniſhed. Thus we have found this place alſo (though ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected againſt us by ſome of our adverſaries with much confidence, yet) indeed to prove nothing at all of that which our adverſaries have endeavoured to prove againſt us by it.</p>
            <p>Another objection is made againſt us from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.1.3. by which place our adverſaries would prove that Chriſt dyed for the ſins of all men,<note place="margin">10. <hi>Object.</hi> From 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15 1.3. anſwered.</note> and conſequently that he preſented to his Fathers juſtice a ſatisfaction for the ſinnes of all men. True it is that Chriſt dyed to this end, that whoſoever believeth in him, the ſame ſhould receive remiſſion of ſinnes, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.43. And Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that his death ſhould be of perfect ſufficiency (as indeed it
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:113580:32"/>is) for the effecting of this. Yet ſtill it is true that he neither did in his death, nor doth in his interceſſion, preſent unto his Fathers ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice a ſatisfaction for the ſins of any, ſave onely of thoſe that doe, or ſhall believe in him; which are his Elect onely. But let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the place objected. The words from which the objection is made, are theſe.—<hi>I declare unto you the Goſpel which I preached unto you.—For I delivered unto you firſt of all, that which I alſo received, how that Chriſt dyed for our ſins according to the Scriptures.</hi> The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſcope here is to ſhew the certainty of Chriſts reſurrection, not onely in it ſelfe, but alſo to the faith of the believing <hi>Corinthians;</hi> and conſequently how fooliſh they ſhould be, if they ſhould deny the reſurrection of the bodies of the Saints, wherein by neceſſary and immediate conſequence, they would be found to deny Chriſts reſurrection. To this end he repreſents unto them how the Goſpel which he at the firſt preached unto them, and they through grace received, did contain in it) as a maine and fundamentall part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) the doctrine of Chriſts reſurrection. This, I ſay, is the Apoſtles ſcope in this place. And thus repreſenting to them (to the end a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned) the Goſpel which he firſt preached to them, he brancheth the doctrine thereof into three Articles. 1. The doctrine concerning Chriſts death. 2. Concerning his buriall. 3. Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his reſurrection. And here he tyes not himſelfe to the ſame forme of words which he at firſt uſed, but onely repreſents unto them the ſubſtance and heads of that doctrine which he firſt prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched unto them. The doctrine of Chriſts death he thus ſets forth; <hi>That Chriſt dyed for our ſins according to the Scriptures.</hi> By the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures he meanes the Scriptures of the old Teſtament: which Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures doe not hold forth Chriſt preſenting to his Fathers juſtice a ſatisfaction for the ſins of all men, but the contrary altogether. The types of Chriſt in and under the Law held him forth as a Prieſt and a Redeemer for his <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and of his <hi>Iſrael</hi> onely: and the reſt of the Nations were looked upon as <hi>aliens from the Common-wealth of Iſrael, and ſtrangers from the Covenants,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.12. Inſomuch that the Apoſtles themſelves for a while (not yet know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the largeneſſe of the extent of Gods <hi>Iſrael</hi> knew not that Chriſt ſhould be found to be a redeemer of any of thoſe Gentiles which were not joyned unto <hi>Iſrael</hi> as Proſelytes. This appeares in <hi>Acts</hi> 10. and 11. ſee alſo <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.3.5.6. And the teſtimony of the Prophets
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:113580:33"/>concerning Chriſt, you may ſee ſummed up in <hi>Acts</hi> 10.43. This then was the Goſpel which the Apoſtles (and conſequently <hi>Paul,</hi> who preached the ſame Goſpel that the reſt of the Apoſtles did) did every where preach; <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſt according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures did dye for the taking and putting away of all the ſinnes of all thoſe that did or ſhould believe in him; compare <hi>Acts</hi> 10.43. with <hi>Acts</hi> 15.7. This doctrine <hi>Paul</hi> in this his briefe repetition di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly applyes, not onely to himſelfe, but alſo to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to whom he wrote, becauſe he looked upon them as believers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. and 6.11. And thus it appeares that this Scripture alſo makes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for our adverſaries in this controverſie or queſtion.</p>
            <p>Whereas ſome of our adverſaries doe endeavour to trouble both themſelves and us with an objection from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.22. we will next. conſider that place.<note place="margin">11. <hi>Object.</hi> From 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 22. anſwered.</note> The words of the Apoſtle there are theſe: <hi>As in Adam all dye, even ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive:</hi> or as ſome tranſlate; <hi>As by Adam all dye, even ſo by Chriſt ſhall all be made alive.</hi> Touching which place, mind theſe things. 1. The Apoſtle doth not there ſpeake of ſomething already paſt, but onely of ſomething to come. If he had there ſpoken of Chriſts preſenting in his death a ſatisfaction to his Fathers juſtice for the ſins of all men, he would have ſaid; <hi>As in Adam all have dyed, even ſo in Chriſt all have been made alive.</hi> 2. The Apoſtle there ſpeakes of the reſurrection of the body unto life, even to the life of glory; of that which Chriſt calls <hi>The reſurrection</hi> in <hi>Luk.</hi> 20.35, 36. Of the ſame which he ſpeakes of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward in this Chapter, <hi>verſ.</hi> 42, 43, 44. Neither doth he in this Chapter ſpeake immediately and directly of any other reſurrection. 3. By <hi>all</hi> therefore we muſt here underſtand onely all thoſe that are Chriſts; <hi>verſ.</hi> 23. of whom Chriſt is the firſt fruits; <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. Upon all theſe, as well as upon the reſt of mankinde, death entred by <hi>Adam</hi> and in <hi>Adam:</hi> and to all theſe, though not to the reſt of mankind, there ſhall be a glorious reſurrection of the body by Chriſt and in Chriſt. If this were not true, then Chriſt were not riſen, and ſo our faith were vaine, and we yet in our ſinnes. Theſe things being thus cleare, I doe not feare any objection from this place.</p>
            <p>There ſeemes unto ſome to be ſomewhat againſt us in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14, 15.<note place="margin">12. <hi>Object.</hi> From 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14, 15. anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> Therefore that place alſo ſhall now be diligently weighed. The words are theſe; <hi>The love of Chriſt conſtraineth us, becauſe we thus judge, that if one dyed for all, then were all dead: And that be dyed for
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:113580:33"/>all, that they which live, ſhould not henceforth live unto themſelves, but unto him which dyed for them, and roſe againe.</hi> Let the coherence and ſcope of this text be minded. The Apoſtle had before expreſſed his labouring to keepe a good conſcience, <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. and 11. And in that expreſſion concerning himſelfe, he ſeemed to joyne himſelfe with others that faithfully aſſiſted him in the preaching of the Goſpel. Here he declares the ſtrong motive that ſtill put him on upon that holy labouring; <hi>viz.</hi> The love of Chriſt apprehended by faith. This love of Chriſt to him he declares and commends by Chriſts dying for him, when he himſelfe was dead. He ſhews alſo the end for which Chriſt ſo ſhewed this love unto him; <hi>viz.</hi> That hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth he might not live unto himſelfe, but unto Chriſt who dyed for him. And in holding forth all this, he extends the ſame (as there was good cauſe for it) to all believers: but with any other he med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not in this place. The word <hi>All</hi> is here uſed, as in <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.8. for all the ſons, not all perſons; for all the Saints, (<hi>Chap.</hi> 1.1.) not all men; for all that are in Chriſt, (<hi>verſ.</hi> 17.) not for all in the world. And Chriſts dying for them all, ſhews that they were all dead in themſelves, elſe Chriſt needed not to have dyed for them. It is objected, that all men in the world were thus dead in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. <hi>Anſ.</hi> The thing indeed is true; but the Apoſtle had no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to take any notice of it, or to make any uſe of it here; but onely of this, that we who now live through grace, were once mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably dead, as ſufficiently appeares by Chriſts dying for us to ſave us from this miſery. The Apoſtle hath the like expreſſion in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.23. <hi>For all have ſinned, and come Short of the glory of God.</hi> Though this in it ſelfe be true of all men without exception, yet it is manifeſt by that which there goes before in <hi>verſ.</hi> 22. and that alſo which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in <hi>verſ.</hi> 24, 25, and 26. that the Apoſtle there ſpeakes onely of all thoſe that doe believe. Whereas our adverſaries would obſerve in this ſaying in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.15. that they which live are but a part of thoſe <hi>all</hi> for whom Chriſt is there ſaid to have dyed; they therein endeavour to obſerve that which the Apoſtle neither ſpake, nor meant. For by <hi>they which live,</hi> is there meant onely <hi>they living.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereas our adverſaries would either confirme their objection from the place laſt anſwered unto,<note place="margin">13. <hi>Object.</hi> From 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19. anſwered.</note> or elſe trouble us with another, from that which follows in <hi>verſ.</hi> 19.—<hi>God was in Chriſt, reconciling the world unto himſelfe, not imputing their treſpaſſes unto them.</hi> I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:113580:34"/>thus anſwer. The word <hi>world,</hi> muſt there be underſtood as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.12.15. and ſo not be extended beyond thoſe to whom grace is (or ſhall be) given to believe in Jeſus Chriſt. For theſe onely are the bleſſed ones, to whom God imputeth not ſin; as wee have already ſeene in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.6, 7, 8. Theſe onely are they that are afterwards ſpoken of in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. for whom the Father made Chriſt to be ſinne, that they might be made the righteouſneſſe of God in Chriſt. For God is not fruſtrated of his end there pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</p>
            <p>But the objection which ſeemeth ſtrongeſt againſt us,<note place="margin">14. <hi>Object.</hi> From <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 8. anſwered.</note> is that which is drawne from <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. and ſpecially from <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. of that Chapter, where the Apoſtle hath theſe words; <hi>Therefore as by the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of one, judgement came upon all men to condemnation: even ſo by the righteouſneſſe of one, the free gift came upon all men unto juſtification of life.</hi> Therefore I ſhall now addreſſe my ſelfe by the helpe of God, to give a plaine anſwer to this alſo in words of truth and ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. 1. The ſcope of the Apoſtle here is to commend the infinite love of God unto his children, ſhewen and extended unto them in Jeſus Chriſt, and ſhed abroad in their hearts by the holy Spirit which is given unto them. This will eaſily appeare to any godly perſon that ſhall diligently read from <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. of this Chapter to the end; and ſhall conſider how every verſe depends on that which went immediately before. 2. In the latter part of this Chapter, Jeſus Chriſt as the ſecond or laſt <hi>Adam</hi> (as he is called in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.45.47.) is compared with the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> which firſt <hi>Adam</hi> is ſaid to be the figure of him that was to come, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. For as all that fell, did fall in and by the firſt <hi>Adam:</hi> ſo all that are raiſed againe to eternall life, are raiſed againe in and by Jeſus Chriſt. Other things wherein the ſimilitude doth either hold, or not hold, between <hi>Adam</hi> and Chriſt. I leave the Reader to conſider in the Chapter. 3. Whereas in <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. the Apoſtle ſpeakes of an <hi>abundance of grace, and of the gift of righteouſneſſe,</hi> which believers receive; this is not meant of a greater meaſure of grace received by ſome believers then by others: but it commends the abundant excellency of that grace, and gift of righteouſneſſe which all believers doe receive, whereby they are aſſured, that they ſhall reigne in life by Jeſus Chriſt. Here alſo conſider <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. of this chap. and compare this 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
               <hi>verſ.</hi> therewith. 4. All they upon whom the free gift came unto juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:113580:34"/>of life, by the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, and all they which ſhall be made righteous by his obedience (as it is in <hi>verſ.</hi> 19.) ſhall be ſaved eternally: as alſo further appeares in <hi>verſ.</hi> 9, 10. and in <hi>verſ.</hi> 21. of this Chapter. 5. Thoſe <hi>all men</hi> on whom judgement came unto condemnation by the offence of <hi>Adam,</hi> and thoſe <hi>many</hi> that were made ſinners by his diſobedience; (as it is in <hi>verſ.</hi> 19.) are all thoſe, and onely thoſe, that are (or ſhall be) from <hi>Adam</hi> and by <hi>Adam</hi> in reſpect of naturall life and being; and were according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſented by <hi>Adam</hi> when he fell. Thus the man Jeſus the Son of the virgin <hi>Marie,</hi> was exempted. As he was not by <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was he repreſented by him when he fell. He was not for his own part, and as touching his own perſon, made a ſinner by <hi>Adams</hi> diſobedience, as we were: neither did the judgement ſo come upon him to condemnation by <hi>Adams</hi> offence, as it came upon us. For then he had been under condemnation for his own originall ſinne. So that even here the words <hi>all men</hi> are not to be taken in the largeſt extent, without any limitation. 6. Accordingly thoſe <hi>all men</hi> on whom the free gift came unto juſtification of life by the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt, and thoſe <hi>many</hi> which ſhall be made righteous by the obedience of Chriſt, (as it is in <hi>verſ.</hi> 19.) are all thoſe, and onely thoſe, that are (or ſhall be) from Chriſt and by Chriſt in reſpect of new life, and their being new creatures, being borne (or begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten) of him, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.29. who were accordingly repreſented by Chriſt when he dyed and roſe againe, as I have<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 40.</note> already ſhewed. Thus the ſeed of the Serpent is excluded. And thus even here alſo (through the goodneſſe of God) the light of truth ſhines forth, and the miſt of errour vaniſheth before it.</p>
            <p>Some conceive that they ſhall finde ſomething againſt us in the ſaying of <hi>Caiaphas</hi> recorded in <hi>Joh.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

But in as much as <hi>Caiaphas</hi> now ſpake not of himſelfe, but being high Prieſt that yeare, did propheſie; we ſhall certainly find nothing againſt us in his ſpeech. The ſaying of <hi>Caiaphas</hi> was this; <hi>Tee know nothing at all, nor conſider that it is expedient for us,</hi> (that is, for us

               <hi>Jewes;</hi> for the Nation of the <hi>Jewes</hi>) <hi>that one man ſhould dye for the people, and that the whole Nation periſh not.</hi> Hereupon <hi>John</hi> gives this note; — <hi>He propheſied that Jeſus ſhould dye for that Nation,</hi> &amp;c. The dying of Jeſus for that nation, was his dying for the redemption of all the children of God of that Nation; yea of all the children of God whereſoever ſcattered abroad, of what Nation ſoever they were: of all which children of God that Nation (in the ſeparation thereof from the reſt of the world to be a peculiar people unto God) had hitherto been an appointed type. For ſo <hi>John</hi> further explaines it in <hi>verſ.</hi> 52. <hi>And not for that Nation onely, but that be ſhould gather together in one the children of God that were ſcattered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.</hi> This onely holds forth that Jeſus was to preſent unto the juſtice of God his Father, a ſatisfaction for the ſins of all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God of what nation ſoever, and that hereby their ſalvation ſhould be effected. So it confirmes the ſame truth that wee main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</p>
            <p>But yet our adverſaries ſeeme confident that by the words of our Saviour in <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.31, 32.<note place="margin">16 <hi>Object.</hi> From <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.31, 32. an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</note> they ſhall prove that all ſins againſt the Law (conſidered as ſinnes againſt the Law) are forgiven to all men; and conſequently, that Chriſt hath preſented a ſatisfaction to his Fathers juſtice for the ſins of all men. Let us therefore with all ſeriouſneſſe, and in the feare of the Lord, conſider that place alſo; and diligently mind both what is ſaid, and alſo what is truly to be ſaid concerning it. The words of our Saviour there are thus ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred; — <hi>All manner of ſin and blaſphemy ſhall be forgiven unto men: but the blaſphemy againſt the Spirit ſhall not be forgiven unto men. And whoſoever ſpeaketh a word againſt the Sonne of man, it ſhall be forgiven him: but whoſoever ſpeaketh againſt the holy Spirit, it ſhall not be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.</hi> Here let theſe things be conſidered.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Whereas our adverſaries find fault with the laſt tranſlation in the former part of <hi>verſ.</hi> 31. contending that the words ought there to be thus rendred; <hi>Every ſin and blaſphemie;</hi> I have already<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 43.</note> proved that the word <hi>All,</hi> or <hi>Every,</hi> doth ſometimes ſignifie onely ſome of all ſorts, or of every ſort.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whereas they bring this place to prove the forgiving of all ſins againſt the Law to all men, but not of any ſins againſt the Goſpel; (which they acknowledge not to be forgiven to all men) let it be
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:113580:35"/>minded that Chriſt here ſpeakes of ſins againſt the Goſpel, as well as of ſins againſt the Law; unleſſe it be no ſin againſt the Goſpel to ſpeake againſt Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Obſerve that Chriſt doth not here ſay, every ſin and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie <hi>is forgiven unto men;</hi> and whoſoever ſpeaketh againſt the Son of man, <hi>it is forgiven him.</hi> But he ſpeakes with manifeſt and expreſſe reference unto time to come; <hi>It ſhall be forgiven.</hi> Even as he ſaith of the blaſphemy againſt the holy Spirit, with reference to the ſame time to come; <hi>It ſhall not be forgiven, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.</hi> But by the doctrine of our adverſaries, every ſin and blaſphemy, that they underſtand to be here ſo ſpoken of, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready forgiven to all men; yea and they would have this place to ſeeme to prove it. I ſuppoſe they will ſay, that Chriſt did here thus ſpeake of the time to come, becauſe he had not yet ſuffered for mens ſinnes. But this reaſon is inſufficient. For though Chriſt had not yet actually ſuffered, yet his ſufferings were already accepted of the Father, and ſo effectuall for the putting away of the ſins of all thoſe that were partakers of him; ſee <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.19. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.13. <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.2. And this ſaying of Chriſt in <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.31, 32. doth as well belong to the time after his paſſion, as to that particular time in which Chriſt ſo ſpake it: as alſo appeares in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.26, 27. and 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.16.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Whereas our adverſaries conceive, or take it for granted, that the ſin againſt the holy Spirit here ſpoken of, which ſhall never be forgiven, is nothing elſe but finall unbeliefe; in this alſo they doe greatly erre. For they which doe fall into this ſin, doe fall into it in their life-time; yea ſometimes long before their death. Thus it was with thoſe Phariſees that had now committed this ſinne: ſee <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.24, 25. with <hi>verſ.</hi> 31, 32. and <hi>Mark.</hi> 3.22.28, 29, 30. This alſo appeares in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4, 5, 6. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.26, 27, 28, 29. Moreover, there are multitudes, yea millions of unbelievers, that goe to eternall deſtruction without committing this ſin. And here, I conceive, it will neither be impertinent, nor unprofitable, to ſhew what this ſin is. This ſin againſt the holy spirit, is the ſin of thoſe that wittingly and wilfully oppoſe with odious blaſphemies the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, and Jeſus Chriſt himſelfe as he is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and ſubject of his Goſpel. 1. This ſin is an oppoſing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting of the whole Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, and of Jeſus Christ
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:113580:36"/>himſelfe as he is the author and ſubject of his Goſpel. Therefore the committers of this ſin are not onely ſaid to fall away, but alſo to crucifie to themſelves the Son of God afreſh, and to put him to an open ſhame, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.6. Yea they are ſaid to tread underfoot the Son of God, and to count his bloud an unholy thing, and to doe deſpite unto the Spirit of grace, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. 2. This ſin is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ignorantly, but againſt a great and cleare light of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.26. <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.38. 3. This ſin is not committed through infirmitie, but wilfully, in the exerciſe of a full and ſetled malice, even againſt Chriſt, not onely knowne but alſo minded to be Chriſt, and againſt his Goſpel, both knowne and minded to be his Goſpel, and againſt the commands and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations of the Spirit of grace, though knowne and minded to be his commands and invitations: and accordingly this Deviliſh ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice caries on the ſinner to abominable blaſphemies, and makes him alwayes to hate all thoughts of repentance, though he expect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but fiery indignation. All this is to be ſeene by the light of theſe places of Scripture, <hi>viz. Heb.</hi> 6.6. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.26, 27.29. And this ſin is called, The ſin (or blaſphemie) againſt the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, becauſe it is ſo committed againſt the worke of the holy Spirit, giving ſuch a light of the knowledge of the Goſpel, and calling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſinner to obey the Goſpel ſo revealed. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> is ſin a man falls into when he is onely enlightened (by the worke of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit) with the knowledge of the Goſpel, and called upon (by the ſame Spirit) to yeeld obedience thereunto: and God doth not adde a further powerfull worke, giving unto him a new heart, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a new ſpirit within him. And thus is diſcovered the deſperate wickedneſſe of mans heart, and his hatred of the Goſpel, which would in like manner appeare in all, if all were dealt with in like fort. By this it may be diſcerned how groſſe the errour of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries is, who account this ſin and blaſphemie againſt the Spirit to be nothing elſe but finall unbeliefe.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The ſcope of our Saviour here was to ſhew that this ſinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the holy Spirit, ſhall never be forgiven to any perſon that once falles into it; and that herein this ſinne differs from all other ſinnes that men commit. For there is no ſin but it may be forgiven, and is (or ſhall be) forgiven to ſome that have committed it, this ſin onely excepted: there being no ſin, ſave onely this, which may
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:113580:36"/>not be repented of, and is not repented of (through Gods mightie grace) by ſome that have committed it. Our adverſaries doe not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſtraitly preſſe us with theſe words; <hi>Whoſoever ſpeaketh a word againſt the Son of man, it ſhall be forgiven him.</hi> Whereto I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That this clauſe, <hi>It ſhall be forgiven him,</hi> doth here ſignifie no more then, <hi>it may be forgiven him.</hi> As in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.15. this clauſe, <hi>He himſelfe ſhall be ſaved,</hi> doth ſignifie no more then, <hi>he himſelfe may be ſaved.</hi> For it is not of neceſſitie that every one muſt be ſaved, that builds hay and ſtubble on Chriſt the foundation; that is, brings falſe profeſſors of faith into an outward union in Church-fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with others that are built on Chriſt the Rocke. Thus it ſtill remaines firme, that no ſin is indeed remitted to unbelievers. And thus this place makes not againſt us.</p>
            <p>Some of our adverſaries doe alſo object againſt us,<note place="margin">17. <hi>Object.</hi> From <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33, 34. anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> 
               <hi>Jere.</hi> 31.33, 34. affirming that God hath now made the Covenant there ſpoken of, with all men; and conſequently that all mens ſins are forgiven. This therefore ſhall next be inquired into. The words of that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are theſe; <hi>This ſhall be the Covenant that I will make with the houſe of Iſrael; Aſter thoſe dayes, ſaith the Lord, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and will be their God, and they ſhall be my people. And they ſhall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, ſaying, Know the Lord: for they ſhall all know me, from the leaſt of them unto the greateſt of them, ſaith the Lord: for I will forgive their iniquitie, and I will remember their ſin no more.</hi> Touching which Scripture I affirme, and undertake to prove, that God hath not made the Covenant here ſpoken of, with all men, but with his Elect onely. 1. The Scripture doth not teach us, by the <hi>houſe of Iſrael</hi> to underſtand all men. 2. This Covenant God keepes and performes, with all thoſe, and unto all thoſe that he hath made it with: otherwiſe God were not faithfull, but rather falſe and deceiving; which to imagine were odious blaſphemy. But God performes this Covenant onely to his Elect. 3. It is manifeſt from the latter part of <hi>verſ.</hi> 34. that God performes this Covenant both to all thoſe, and onely to thoſe, whoſe iniquitie he will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give, and whoſe ſin he will remember no more. This place there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is ſo farre from ſpeaking for our adverſaries, as that it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws them altogether. But they object that all of the <hi>houſe of Iſrael</hi> are not Gods Elect. I anſwer, that <hi>Iſrael</hi> notwithſtanding did ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pifie
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:113580:37"/>the whole companie of Gods Elect, as alſo is intimated in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 135.4. and accordingly they who are declared to be Gods Elect, are called <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>Iſraelites</hi> indeed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.6. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.47. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.16. They further object, that God puts his Law in the inward parts, and writes it in the hearts of ſome (at the leaſt) that are not his Elect. I anſwer, that the Law here ſpoken of, is the very doctrine of the Goſpel; and that Gods putting this Law into mens inward parts, &amp; writing it in their hearts, is his making them to underſtand, and to love; to believe, and to obey this Goſpel. And this God workes onely in his Elect, whom he makes his own people, and he is found to be their God. For this ſee <hi>Jere.</hi> 24.7. <hi>Jere.</hi> 32.38, 39, 40. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.19, 20. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26, 27, 28. It being a cleare and moſt manifeſt truth, (though ſome of our adverſaries are ſo blind, that they cannot ſee it) that that precious promiſe in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 54.13. is made onely to the Elect.</p>
            <p>Some endeavour to frame an objection againſt us from <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24.<note place="margin">18. <hi>Object.</hi> From <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 24. anſwered.</note> where we thus read; <hi>Seaventie weeks are determined upon thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and upon thy holy Citie, to finiſh the tranſgreſſion, and to make an end of ſins, and to make reconciliation for iniquitie, and to bring in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting righteouſneſſe,</hi> &amp;c. But all this is ſpoken with a manifeſt refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and reſtriction to Gods Elect. —<hi>Thy people;</hi> that is, The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> (who are thy people after the fleſh, thou being one of that ſeparated Nation;) <hi>viz.</hi> as they are a type of the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, and no otherwayes.

Theſe onely are that <hi>Jacob</hi> the Lords ſervant, and that <hi>Iſrael</hi> whom he hath choſen, (<hi>Iſai.</hi> 44.1.) whoſe tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions he blotteth out for his own ſake, and will not remember their ſinnes, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 43.25.

Theſe are they to whom the Lord proclaimed himſelfe, not onely mercifull and gracious, long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering, and abundant in goodneſſe and truth; but alſo keeping mercy for thouſands, forgiving iniquitie and tranſgreſſion and ſin, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6, 7.

            <p>Some endeavour to confirme the objection that I have now an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, by another objection from <hi>Iſai.</hi> 40.1, 2.<note place="margin">19. <hi>Object.</hi> From <hi>Iſai.</hi> 40.1, 2. anſwered.</note> where it is thus written; <hi>Comfort yee, my people, ſaith your God.

But they ſhould here take notice that by <hi>my people,</hi> the Lord clearely meanes his choſen people, and none other. This therefore is to be applyed to the Elect onely. They object, that this was ſpoken of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which then was. That believers in that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> were even then to make uſe of it, is acknowledged. But it is manifeſt that as this was onely meant of believers, ſo it was ſpecially meant of believers which ſhould be in the time of the Goſpel more fully declared, and of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which is above, which ſhould then be more clearely diſcovered and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly enlarged.

               <hi>He was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, he was bruiſed for our iniquities: the chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him, and with his ſtripes we are healed.

They conceive that all men are brought in here ſpeaking, or (at<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leaſt) ſome ſpeaking as in the name of all: whereas indeed onely believers doe here ſpeake.

Moreover, I demand this of our oppoſers, whether this confeſſion (being ſincerely made) doe not ſhew a man to be a believer; <hi>viz. Chriſt was wounded for my tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, he was bruiſed for my iniquioies,</hi> &amp;c. They dare not anſwer negatively. How then dare they affirme that any other beſide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, doe here make this confeſſion? Though many unbelievers did eſteeme the Lord Jeſus in his paſſion to be ſtricken, ſmitten of God, and afflicted, according to that ſaying in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 53.4. yet one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe that were afterward converted to the faith, did come to ſuch a fight and humble acknowledgement of that their ſinfull er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, as is there held forth. But poſſibly it will be objected unto
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:113580:38"/>us, that it is written in <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.16, 17. <hi>They brought unto Jeſus many that were poſſeſſed with devills, and be caſt out the ſpirits with his word, and healed all that were ſicke: That it might be fulfilled which was ſpoken by Eſaias the Prophet, ſaying, Himſelfe tooke our infirmities, and bare our ſickneſſes.</hi> Which hath cleare relation unto that in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.4. <hi>Surely he hath borne our griefes, and caried our ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes.</hi> Which makes it ſeeme probable (at leaſt) unto ſome, that this is to be extended farther then to believers onely. Hereto there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I thus anſwer. 1. The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> there manifeſtly ſpeakes of Chriſts bearing our ſinnes, which are there called <hi>our griefes,</hi> and <hi>our ſorrowes,</hi> becauſe they are cauſes of griefe and ſorrow. Here in <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.17. they are in like manner called <hi>our infirmities,</hi> and <hi>our ſickneſſes,</hi> becauſe they are cauſes of infirmitie and ſickneſſe: for it is ſin that hath brought in all griefe and ſorrow, infirmitie and ſickneſſe. 2. The love and compaſſion that Chriſt effectually ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in caſting out the Devills out of thoſe that were poſſeſſed with them, and healing the ſicke, did prove him to be that promiſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, which ſhould ſo beare and carrie the griefes and ſorrowes of his people. And all the good which he did to men by ſuch his workes, was the fruit (and ſo alſo the evidence) of that his bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſinnes of his people. And therefore, I conceive, the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt ſaid that he did this, <hi>That it might be fulfilled which was ſpoken by Iſaiah the Prophet,</hi> &amp;c. that is, That the fulfilling thereof might be manifeſt. 3. The perſons to whom Chriſt ſo ſhewed compaſſion, were either indeed Gods choſen ones, or at leaſt of the nation of the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> (which were the appointed type of all Gods Elect.) See <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.2.22. <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.53. <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.9. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.5. <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.24 &amp;c. And thus it was intimated who they were whoſe griefes and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes Chriſt came to beare and to carrie; <hi>viz.</hi> Gods peculiar and choſen people.</p>
            <p>There is alſo an objection made from <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 12.3.<note place="margin">21. <hi>Object.</hi> From <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.3. anſwered.</note> (and other like places) where God ſaid unto <hi>Abraham, In thee ſhall all families of the earth be bleſſed.</hi> But this is fully taken off in <hi>Galat.</hi> 3.8, 9. where the Apoſtle ſaith; <hi>The Scripture foreſeeing that God would ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie the heathen through faith, preached before the Goſpel unto Abraham, ſaying, In thee ſhall all Nations be bleſſed. So then, they which be of faith, are bleſſed with faithfull Abraham.</hi> If then we will believe the Spirit of God in the Apoſtle, we muſt acknowledge that the meaning of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:113580:39"/>that promiſe was onely this; That believers of all Nations ſhould be bleſſed in Chriſt the promiſed ſeed of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The words ſpoken by <hi>Peter</hi> to the men of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
               <note place="margin">22. <hi>Object.</hi> From <hi>Acts</hi> 3.26 anſwered</note> recorded in <hi>Acts</hi> 3.26. are by ſome ſuppoſed to be very ſtrong againſt us. Thoſe words therefore ſhall now be taken dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently into conſideration. The words are theſe; <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto you firſt, God having raiſed up his Son Jeſus, ſent him to bleſſe you, is turning away every one of you from his iniquities.</hi> Here let theſe things be conſidered. 1. In as much as God doth never fall ſhort of the end that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds to himſelfe, he muſt be underſtood to have bleſſed theſe <hi>Iſraelites</hi> by his Son Jeſus, in that many of them which then heard the Word, believed, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.4. He bleſſed them then, that is, many of them; <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe that were ordained to eternall life. 2. Whereas it followes; <hi>In turning away every one of you from his iniquities.</hi> This implyes that they onely ſhould ſhew themſelves partakers of this bleſſing, who ſhould ſhew their believing in Jeſus Chriſt through the grace of God, by being turned away (through the ſame grace of God) from their iniquities. <hi>In turning away every one of you; viz.</hi> whom he bleſſeth, or ſhall bleſſe, by his Son. And wee have proved in our anſwer to the objection aforegoing, that they onely are bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in Chriſt, that believe in him. 3. This their being turned away from their iniquities, was a being truly converted from the love and ſervice of ſinne, to the loathing and forſaking of it. And thus this place alſo doth indeed make nothing againſt us.</p>
            <p>Some have endeavoured to frame an objection againſt us from the words of our Saviour to the Phariſees in <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.41.<note place="margin">23. <hi>Object.</hi> From <hi>Joh</hi> 9. 41. anſwered.</note> 
               <hi>If yee were blind, yee ſhould have no ſin.</hi> From theſe words they would inferre, that theſe Phariſees had not been chargeable of any ſin, if the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel had not been preached to them; and conſequently, that Chriſt had taken away from them their ſinnes againſt the Law; and if he tooke thoſe ſins away from them, then alſo from all men. Our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is as followes. 1. Chriſt doth not ſay to theſe Phariſees, <hi>If the Goſpel had not been preached unto you;</hi> But; <hi>If yee were blind.</hi> 2. He doth not ſay, <hi>Yee ſhould not have been chargeable of any ſin:</hi> But onely with reference to the time preſent and to come, <hi>yee ſhould have no ſin.</hi> 3. He doth not there ſay; <hi>But now the Goſpel hath been preached unto you.</hi> But he ſaith, <hi>But now yee ſay, we ſee.</hi> 4. Chriſt plainly tells them, <hi>Your ſin remaineth.</hi> If their ſin remained, then Chriſt did not take it
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:113580:39"/>from them. Their ſin which remained, was not onely ſin againſt the Goſpel, but alſo ſin againſt the Law. Their devouring widowes houſes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.14. Their omitting the weightier matters of the Law, judgement, mercy, and faithfulneſſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.23. Their extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and exceſſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.25. yea it ſeemes our oppoſers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves underſtand Chriſt to ſpeake in this verſe of ſinne againſt the Law: for otherwiſe they would not have brought this place (as they have done) to prove Chriſts taking away ſinnes againſt the Law from thoſe that continue finally in unbeliefe. Thus this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſo farre from oppoſing our doctrine, that it confirmes it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together. 5. The true meaning of this Scripture, is this; <hi>If ye were blind;</hi> that is, <hi>If yee did ſay, we are blind.</hi> This interpretation is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the antitheſis or oppoſition following; <hi>But now yee ſay, we ſee.</hi> If yee did ſay, we are blind; <hi>viz.</hi> being ſenſible of your blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſincerely and freely acknowledging it, and ſo exerciſing and manifeſting true repentance and faith. Compare this with 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9. <hi>If yee confeſſe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ye ſhould have no ſin;</hi> that is, <hi>Your ſinne ſhould not remaine.</hi> This alſo is confirmed by the antitheſis in the laſt words of the verſe; <hi>Therefore your ſin remaineth.</hi> Your ſin ſhould not remaine; for <hi>if we confeſſe our ſinnes, God is faithfull and juſt to forgive us our ſinnes, and to clenſe from all unrighteouſneſſe,</hi> 1 Joh. 1.9. If any ſhall yet reject this true expoſition of this Scripture, he muſt be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to ſay, that mans blindnes whereby he doth not behold the light of the Goſpel of Chriſt, doth make a man to have no ſinne. Then which nothing can be ſpoken more abſurdly, nor more falſely.</p>
            <p>The ſame oppoſers have endeavoured to ſtrengthen their former objection by another (like unto it) from the words of Chriſt in <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.22.24.<note place="margin">24. <hi>Object.</hi> From <hi>Joh</hi> 15.22.24. anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> 
               <hi>If I had not come and ſpoken unto them, they had not had ſin. —If I had not done among them the workes which none other man did, they had not bad ſin.</hi> From hence alſo they would in like manner inferre, that the men of whom Chriſt here ſpeakes, had not been chargeable of any ſin, if the Goſpel had not been preached to them. Our anſwer is this. Chriſt did not here ſay, <hi>If the Goſpel had not been preached to them.</hi> But, <hi>If I had not come and ſpoken unto them.</hi> That is, If I had not come and preached to them in mine own perſon. And, <hi>If I had not done among them the works which none other man did:</hi> That is, If I had not wrought my mightie workes and miracles among
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:113580:40"/>them. Therefore when Chriſt here ſaith, <hi>They had not had ſin;</hi> he doth not meane, They had been in no wiſe chargeable of any ſin: But, They ſhould not have been ſo manifeſtly inexcuſable in groſſe and open ſin. For ſo the word <hi>ſinners</hi> doth ſometimes ſignifie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons manifeſtly inexcuſable in groſſe and open ſins: as you may ſee in <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.10. The <hi>Jewes</hi> were chargeable of ſinne before Chriſt wrought his miracles among them; before he preached unto them in his owne perſon; and before his incarnation; ſee <hi>Amos</hi> 2.4, 5. Yea the men of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Zidon</hi> were chargeable of ſin; and the men of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> were chargeable of ſin; ſee <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.49, 50. and <hi>Jude</hi> 7. Our interpretation of Chriſts words doth agree plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the cleare meaning of that in <hi>James</hi> 4.17. <hi>To him that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to doe good, and doth it not, to him it is ſin.</hi> That is, To him it is manifeſtly groſſe and inexcuſable ſin. And this interpretation is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confirmed by the antitheſis preſently following in <hi>verſ.</hi> 22. <hi>But now they have no cloake</hi> (or, <hi>no excuſe</hi>) <hi>for their ſin.</hi> Thus this place alſo is farre from proving that which it hath been brought to prove againſt us.</p>
            <p>The ſaying of the Apoſtle in <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.20. is alſo by ſome objected againſt us,<note place="margin">25. <hi>Object.</hi> From <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.20. anſwered.</note> as if it contradicted our doctrine. The ſaying of the Apoſtle there is this; <hi>And (having made peace through the bloud of his croſſe) by him to reconcile all things unto himſelfe; by him, I ſay, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.</hi> Our anſwer hereto ſhall conſiſt of theſe branches. 1. Whereas ſome of our oppoſers take <hi>all things</hi> here in the largeſt ſenſe, comprehending all creatures, and ſo Angells as well as men; this is a manifeſt errour. The holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels needed no reconciler. The Angels that fell are not reconciled; neither did Chriſt take on him the nature of Angels, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.16. And I believe, our oppoſers will not ſay, that Chriſt preſented to his Fathers juſtice a ſatisfaction for the ſinnes of Angels. 2. It hath been already proved<note n="*" place="margin">In Pag. 43.</note> that the word <hi>All</hi> muſt ſometimes be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood with limitation to the preſent ſubject ſpoken of. See another example of it in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.12. <hi>All things are lawfull,</hi> &amp;c. Where un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>all things,</hi> you may not comprehend theft, adultery, lying, &amp;c. but onely all meates which had been forbidden to the <hi>Jewes</hi> in the Law given by <hi>Moſes:</hi> as there appeares in the verſe following. 3. Though the Apoſtle here ſeeme to ſpeak of things, yet he meanes men, and no other things. So when he ſaith in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.27, 28.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:113580:40"/>
               <hi>God hath choſen the fooliſh things of the world,</hi> &amp;c. he meaneth onely perſons. 4. Neither can <hi>All things</hi> here ſignifie all men univerſally, and every particular perſon whatſoever. For if every perſon were reconciled to God by the bloud of Chriſt, then every perſon muſt be ſaved eternally, as appeares in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8, 9, 10. By <hi>All things</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are here to underſtand All the members of that body of which Chriſt is the head, <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. All thoſe that either already were, or afterwards ſhould be, ſuch as theſe <hi>Coloſſians</hi> now were, to whom this is applyed in the enſuing verſes. 5. By <hi>things in heaven</hi> are here meant the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.23. who being abſent from the body, are preſent with the Lord, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.8.</p>
            <p>There remaines yet an objection from Chriſts words in <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.2. which ſeemes to ſome to raze a great part of the foundation on which we have built.<note place="margin">26. <hi>Object.</hi> From <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.2. anſwered.</note> It is therefore expedient that the ſame ſhould be clearely and fully anſwered. The inference that is made, is this. Unfruitfull perſons that periſh eternally, are, or ſometime were, in Chriſt. Therefore they were in Chriſt when he ſuffered. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt, when he ſuffered, made ſatisfaction to his Fathers ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice for their ſinnes. But let us firſt conſider the words of Chriſt, from which ſome endevour thus to reaſon, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.1, 2. <hi>I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman; every branch in me that beareth not fruit, be taketh away,</hi> &amp;c. And that our oppoſers may not be too confident, let them in the meane time mind the cleare ſaying of <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. <hi>There is no condemnation to them which are in Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> and remember that that which there followes in the latter part of that verſe <hi>(viz. who walke not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit)</hi> is not an exception from any thing that went before, or a reſtraining of a generall terme to one particular comprehended under it, but an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of that which immediately went before; and ſo a deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe that are manifeſted to be in Chriſt Jeſus; ſee 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. Here then is held forth the full juſtification, and conſequently, the eternall ſalvation of all thoſe whom the Apoſtle ſpeakes of as perſons truly in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p>As touching that ſaying of Chriſt in <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. let it be conſidered whether it be not a figurative ſpeech; an allegoricall or metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſpeech. If we ſpeake without any metaphore, and underſtand our words according to their proper and literall ſenſe or ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:113580:41"/>without any figure, then we cannot truly ſay, that Chriſt is a vine; that the Father is an husbandman; that diſciples are branches. The meaning then is onely this; That Chriſt is like a vine, or as it were a vine, yea the true vine: The Father is like an husbandman, or as it were an husbandman: the diſciples are like branches, or as it were branches. They therefore which utterly reject the uſe of this word <hi>as it were,</hi> in the opening of this and ſuch like Scriptures, doe not rightly divide the Word. Diſciples are as it were branches of the true vine, in a twofold reſpect. 1. In reſpect of communion with the Church of Chriſt in the outward worſhip of God and the uſe of Chriſts Ordinances. Thus though not all men, yet all Church-members are as it were branches of the true vine, and ſo to be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon by us, till they are (or at leaſt ought to be) caſt out of the Church for their manifeſt unfruitfulneſſe. 2. In reſpect of true com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion and union with Chriſt. Thus onely true believers are as it were branches of the true vine, and ſo looked upon by God.</p>
            <p>As touching that in <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. If I be not miſ-informed, it is word for word, <hi>Every branch in me not bearing fruit.</hi> Then the meaning may be this; <hi>Every branch that beareth not fruit in me.</hi> This implyes onely thus much; That there are Church-members, who though they be as it were branches of the true vine in that reſpect that I firſt mentioned, and ſo to us in Chriſt in reſpect of outward profeſſion and communion; yet doe not beare fruit in Chriſt: and ſo doe not ſhew themſelves to be really in Chriſt, but the contrary. Theſe the Father <hi>taketh away: viz</hi> caſting them out of his Church, and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with eternall deſtruction. That they which abide not in Chriſt, were never in him really, appeares not onely by that in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. already alledged, but alſo by theſe Scriptures among ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.23. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.14. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.27. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.3, 4. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now as touching this conceit, that all men either are, or were in Chriſt; I would demand of thoſe that ſo conceive, whether all men doe for ever continue in Chriſt. I am confident they will not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer affirmatively, as ſeeing clearly that no ſuch thing can be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; and that they cannot make ſuch an opinion to agree with this Scripture, no not by their owne interpretation of the ſame. I would therefore demand of them in the ſecond place, when they which periſh, doe ceaſe to be in Chriſt; whether in this life, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this life. If they will ſay, Not in this life, but after this life;
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:113580:41"/>then muſt they relinquiſh this Scripture, which ſpeakes of mens a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding, or not abiding, in Chriſt in this life; ſee <hi>verſ.</hi> 4, 5, 6, 7. Yea they will be found to hold, (moſt manifeſtly contrary to all truth) that men may be in Chriſt all the time of their life here, and yet periſh eternally. If they will ſay that in this life they ceaſe to be in Chriſt; I would then know when, and how. If they ſay that they ceaſe to be in Chriſt through their unbeliefe, or their unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe; I demand: when were they other then unfruitfull and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing perſons? And if men who neither had, nor ever would or ſhould have, either faith, or fruits, could notwithſtanding be in Chriſt; how comes it to paſſe that unfruitfulneſſe, or unbeliefe makes them ceaſe to be in Chriſt? Thus I ſuppoſe, I have ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manifeſted the weakneſſe and vanitie of this objection.</p>
            <p>The next objection that I will anſwer, ſhall be that from 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20.<note place="margin">27. <hi>Object.</hi> From 2 <hi>Pet</hi> 2. 20. anſwered.</note> 
               <hi>If after they have eſcaped the pollutions of the world, through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, they are againe entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worſe with them, then the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</hi> Hence our oppoſers would inferre, not onely that ſinners periſhing have eſcaped the pollutions of the world; which touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome of thoſe ſinners wee grant, in the Apoſtles ſenſe, not in theirs: but alſo that all their ſinnes againſt the Law, conſidered as ſinnes againſt the Law, are forgiven unto them: which wee neither grant, neither did the Apoſtle meane any ſuch thing. 1. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle doth not here ſpeake of all periſhing ſinners, but onely of ſome, upon whom the doctrine of the Goſpel had had ſuch a work, as that they were thereby outwardly reformed, and purged from outward pollutions, in which the reſt of the unbelieving world did generally lie. Even as <hi>Johns</hi> doctrine did ſo farre work upon <hi>Herod,</hi> that when he heard him, he did many things, <hi>Mark.</hi> 6.20. 2. The Apoſtle doth not ſay, nor meane, that theſe ſinners were juſtified in Gods ſight from any of their ſinnes; but onely that they were out wardly refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in their lives. So they were <hi>waſhed,</hi> verſ. 22. But how? As the ſow that hath wallowed, and is ſtill ready to wallow, in the mire. They were externally waſhed in the outward reformation of their lives, but ſtill retained their ſwiniſh nature. They were not ſo much as ſprinkled with the bloud of Chriſt, and therefore not waſhed in it from the guilt of their finnes. They were juſt like a dog that hath caſt up out of his ſtomack ſome filthy thing that he had ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:113580:42"/>downe, but ſtill retaineth the nature and appetite of a filthy greedy logge. Thus theſe remained filthy dogs and ſwine, being never any of thoſe ſheepe of Chriſt, for whom he laid downe his life, and whom he ſanctifieth by his death, purging them by his bloud from all ſinne, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.15. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.25, 26. <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.5, 6.</p>
            <p>There is another objection made from the words of <hi>Peter</hi> in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.9. which are thus rendred;<note place="margin">28. <hi>Object.</hi> From 2 <hi>Pet</hi> 1.9. anſwered.</note> 
               <hi>But be that locketh theſe things is blind and cannot ſee afarre off, and hath forgetten that be was purged from his old ſinnes.</hi> From which words our oppoſers inferre that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers (and conſequently all men) were purged from their ſins by the bloud of Chriſt. But 1. This cannot be underſtood of one that never was a believer, by their owne doctrine: for though they ſay that all men are purged from their ſins by the bloud of Chriſt, yet they ſay alſo that none doe know and mind this but believers: and they make faith to be nothing elſe but the knowing of this. Now he that hath forgotten this, did ſometime know and mind it. And though ſome of our oppoſers have drunke in this errour alſo, that a true believer may fall away to totall unbeliefe, and ſo periſh; yet the Scripture teacheth us a more comfortable doctrine, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.35. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. 2. There is nothing in this Scripture that requires it to be underſtood of an unbeliever. For though he that totally lacketh theſe things, (<hi>viz. faith, vertue, knowledge, temperance,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>verſ.</hi> 5, 6, 7.) muſt needs be an unbeliever: yet a true believer may ſometimes lacke theſe things in a great meaſure; ſee <hi>James</hi> 1.5, 6. They object, that in the Greeke it is; <hi>He to whom theſe things are not preſent.</hi> We anſwer, that this phraſe here onely imports theſe things not to be unto him in a continuall preſent readineſſe, as it were at his hand continually, for the manifeſtation of them in exerciſe and practiſe. And this is confirmed by the antitheſis in the verſe afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going; <hi>If theſe things be in you, and abound, they will make you that yee ſhall neither be barren, nor unfruitfull in the knowledge of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> This alſo receives further confirmation from that which followes in <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. <hi>For ſo an entrance ſhall be miniſtred unto you abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, into the everlaſting kingdome,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>So;</hi> that is, theſe things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in you, and abounding; theſe things being continually in a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent readineſſe unto you for the manifeſtation and exerciſe of them in your practiſe; you being continually doing theſe things, and ſo never falling, <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. (which is meant not onely of totall, but alſo
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:113580:42"/>of grievous falles:) <hi>An entrance ſhall be miniſtred unto you abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi> that is, you ſhall have abundant aſſurance of your entrance, &amp;c. which abundant aſſurance, even thoſe believers to whom theſe things are not ſo preſent, may remaine ſhort of for a ſeaſon. 3. Whereas that which follows, is in the tranſlation thus rendred; <hi>He is blind, and cannot ſee afar off.</hi> The copulative <hi>And</hi> is not in the Greeke text, but onely theſe words; <hi>He is blind, not ſeeing afar off;</hi> or, <hi>not being able to ſee afar off.</hi> And the ſecond word ſhewes the meaning of the firſt. Though he be not ſo blind as to ſee nothing at all, (for ſo no believer can be) yet he is ſo far blind as not to ſee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>far off. 4. The forgetfulneſſe alſo, or forgetting here ſpoken of, is not totall, (for ſuch indeed is not found in a believer) but onely a forgetting in a great meaſure, like that ſpoken of in <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.5.</p>
            <p>This then is all that here appeares; <hi>viz.</hi> that a man purged from his ſinnes, may yet with the Angel of the Church at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> leave his firſt love, and ſo far fall, as not to doe his firſt workes, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.4, 5. Faith, vertue, knowledge, &amp;c. may be farre from abounding in him, and ſo he may be in a great meaſure barren or unfruitfull. Yea the eyes of his minde may be in a great meaſure dimmed, and his mindfulneſſe of the purging away of his ſinnes, may be much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated. All this proves not the concluſion of our oppoſers, neither oppoſeth our doctrine.</p>
            <p>There is yet another place in this Epiſtle objected unto us;<note place="margin">29. <hi>Object.</hi> From 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9. anſwered.</note> 
               <hi>viz.</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9. <hi>The Lord is not ſlacke concerning his promiſe, (as ſome men count ſlackneſſe) but is long-ſuffering to us-ward, not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to repent ance.</hi> Hence ſome would inferre, that God would have no perſon to periſh; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he gave his Son to preſent a ſatisfaction to his juſtice for the ſins of every perſon. But if the Lord open our eyes, wee ſhall ſee this miſt diſpelled by the light that ſhines from this place. 1. The will of God here ſpoken of, is an effectuall will. For the Greeke word here uſed, holds forth not onely the will of God, but alſo his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile; even that counſaile of his will, according to which he effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally worketh. Therefore the Apoſtle here ſpeakes onely of thoſe whom God effectually ſaves. 2. The Apoſtles ſcope here is to ſhew the cauſe why it was and ſhould be ſo long before Chriſt did and ſhould come to judgement; <hi>viz</hi> that none might periſh, but that all might come to repentance. Even this ſhewes that the Apoſtle hath
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:113580:43"/>here reſpect to none but the Elect, of whom none ſhall periſh, but all of them ſhall come to repentance before Chriſts coming to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 3. When he here ſaith, <hi>The Lord is long ſuffering to us-ward;</hi> by <hi>us</hi> he meanes the Elect, and more particularly, the elect of the Jewiſh Nation, of whom he and they to whom he now wrote, were a part. And when he addes; <hi>not willing that any ſhould periſh;</hi> he in like manner meanes, not willing that any of us his choſen people ſhould periſh. And in that which followes; <hi>But that all ſhould come to repentance;</hi> by <hi>all</hi> he likewiſe meanes All of us his Elect; and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, All of us his Elect of the Nation of the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the objection ſeemes ſtronger that is made from <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.32. and 33.11.<note place="margin">30. <hi>Object.</hi> From <hi>Ezek</hi> 18.12. &amp; 33.11. anſwered.</note> I therefore now haſten to thoſe places, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.32. <hi>I have no pleaſure in the death of him that dyeth, ſaith the Lord God. Ezek.</hi> 33.11. <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord God, I have no pleaſure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turne from his way and live.</hi> For anſwer whereto theſe things are to be minded. 1. God ſometimes ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of himſelfe after the manner of men; and yet thoſe ſpeeches of his are to be underſtood after the manner of God. Thus it is when God aſcribes unto himſelfe anger, ſorrow, and the like. As in <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.6. <hi>It repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him at his heart.</hi> And in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.11. <hi>It repenteth me that I have ſet up Saul to be King.</hi> Yet <hi>Samuel</hi> there ſaith in <hi>verſ.</hi> 29. <hi>The ſtrength of Iſrael will not lye, nor repent: for he is not a man that be ſhould repent.</hi> And thus it is when the Scripture aſcribes to God a taking pleaſure in any thing done by man, or any fruit thereof: as namely when it holds forth God as having pleaſure in this, that the wicked turne from his way, and live. 2. When the Lord ſaith, <hi>I have no pleaſure in the death of him that dyeth: I have no pleaſure in the death of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked:</hi> he declares indeed that he hath no pleaſure in the miſery of his creature in it ſelfe conſidered. Yet it is not contrary to the pleaſure of God to ſet forth the glory of his righteouſneſſe, and power, and juſt wrath againſt ſinners, in the deſtruction of the veſſels of wrath; ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.22. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.26. <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.4. 3. The Scripture holds forth Gods greateſt delight to be, not in a ſinners deſtruction, but in the converſion and ſalvation of ſinners. This is plainly held forth in theſe places. And elſwhere the Scripture manifeſts that the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinners that periſh, is purpoſely ordered of God to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of his infinite and glorious mercy towards thoſe whom
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:113580:43"/>he ſaves, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.22, 23. 4. The ſcope of theſe places is to declare Gods readineſs to accept and ſave thoſe that ſincerely turne to him: and ſo to move and encourage ſinners to ſuch converſion unto God. In all this there is no oppoſition againſt our doctrine.</p>
            <p>In the next place through the helpe of God,<note place="margin">31. <hi>Object.</hi> From <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.47. &amp; <hi>Act.</hi> 13.38. anſwered.</note> I ſhall returne an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to an objection drawne partly from <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.47. <hi>And that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and remiſſion of ſinnes ſhould be preached in his Name among all Nations, beginning at Jeruſalem.</hi> And partly from <hi>Acts</hi> 13.38. <hi>Be it knowne unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveneſſe of ſinnes.</hi> From hence ſome doe thus argue. Remiſſion of ſinnes was to be preached to all men, even to unbelievers, Therefore ſinnes are remitted to all men. I anſwer. 1. In <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.47. obſerve this expreſſion, <hi>Among all Nations.</hi> We rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily grant that the true doctrine of the Goſpel concerning remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinnes, was to be preached among all Nations, and is to be preached among all men. Some object that the Greeke words here ſignifie, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto all Nations.</hi> Wee deny not that the Greeke Praepoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on here uſed, doth ſometimes ſignifie <hi>unto;</hi> properly it ſignifies <hi>into;</hi> and ſometimes, <hi>among.</hi> And this laſt ſignification doth beſt agree in this place. 2. If we here tranſlate, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto all Nations:</hi> yet ſo this Scripture will make nothing againſt us. This doctrine; <hi>Through Chriſts Name, whoſoever believeth in him, ſhall receive remiſſion of ſinnes;</hi> (<hi>Acts</hi> 10.43.) was to be preached to all Nations, and is ſtill to be preached to all. And here (in <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.47.) note how the preaching of repentance, and of remiſſion of ſins, is joyned together: import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Goſpel that was to be preached, teſtifies remiſſion of ſinnes onely to thoſe that repent, or are changed in their mind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.19. 3. Thoſe that are ſpoken to in <hi>Acts</hi> 13.38. were profeſſours of faith in the Meſſiah, as he was hold forth by the light of the old Teſtament, and were now ſo looked upon, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.16.26. 4. Yet the preaching of remiſſion of ſinnes unto them, that was here ſpoken of, was onely the preaching of that doctrine expreſſed in the next verſe; <hi>By Jeſus the Saviour, all that believe, are juſtified from all things.</hi> The particle <hi>And</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of that verſe, doth there import (as oftentimes it doth) a declaration of that which was before ſpoken of.</p>
            <p>But it is objected, that every one is bound to believe that Chriſt preſented a ſatisfaction to divine juſtice for his ſinnes,<note place="margin">32. <hi>Object.</hi> From 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.10, 11.</note> and that his
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:113580:44"/>ſinnes are remitted: Therefore this is true. And ſome conceive that this objection is ſtrengthened by that in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.10, 11.—<hi>He that believeth not God, bath made him a lyar, becauſe be believeth not the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord that God gave of his Son,</hi> &amp;c. My anſwer is this.<note place="margin">Anſw.</note>
            </p>
            <p>What every man is commanded of God to believe, that I grant to be true. For the God of truth commandeth no man to believe a lye. But God commandeth every man to believe what he affirmes, and declares, and no more. This then he declares to be truth, and ſo commands every man to believe it, That through Chriſts Name, whoſoever believeth in him, ſhall receive remiſſion of ſinnes, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.43. This I ſay, God commands every man to believe, and to receive it as the true and good word of God, and ſo to reſt upon it, and obediently to depend upon Jeſus Chriſt held forth in this word, as the Prince and Saviour exalted of God. <hi>Mark.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.36. &amp;c. When a man thus believes, then both the Spirit and the Word of God doth teſtifie and declare that Jeſus Chriſt hath preſented unto divine juſtice a ſatisfaction for his ſinnes in particular, and that accordingly his ſinnes are forgiven unto him. This then he is now (and not till now) bound to believe as a certaine truth; as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is and now appeares to be. And touching the unbelieving and diſobedient perſon, who obeys not the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, this is one part of the truth that God reveales, and commands all to believe; <hi>viz.</hi> that perſons ſtill continuing ſuch, remaine under the curſe and wrath of God, and muſt be judged, condemned, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for all their ſinnes, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Jude</hi> 15.2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.8, 9. As al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo hath been already fully proved. Now God doth not command any man to believe contradictions.</p>
            <p>Touching that in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.10. it is to be minded that a childe of God hath unbeliefe remaining and rebelling in him; and ſometimes it rebells very ſtrongly and grievouſly. As farre as this unbeliefe workes in him, ſo farre he <hi>believes not God,</hi> but <hi>makes him a lyar;</hi> that is, caſts upon him the imputation of lying: <hi>becauſe he believes not on the teſtimony</hi> that <hi>God bath teſtified concerning his Sonne.</hi> That this is <hi>Johns</hi> meaning, appeares by that which follows in <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. <hi>And this is the record</hi> (or <hi>teſtimony</hi>) <hi>that God bath given to us eternall life, and this life is in his Sonne.</hi> God hath not given this eternall life to us men, whether we be believers, or unbelievers: but to us to whom he gives grace to believe in his Son; See <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.36. and 17.2.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:113580:44"/>This is farther confirmed by that which follows in 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.13. <hi>Theſe things have I written unto you that believe on the Name of the Son of God, that yee may know that yee have eternall life, and that yee may believe on the Name of the Son of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is alſo objected that in <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.15.<note place="margin">33. <hi>Object.</hi> From <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.15. anſwered.</note> Chriſt commands that the Goſpel ſhould be preached to every creature: but by our doctrine there remaines no Goſpel to be preached to the world for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of ſinners. I demand. Is this indeed no Goſpel? <hi>viz.</hi> That the Father hath given his onely begotten Son, that whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life. That through Chriſts Name, whoſoever believeth in him, ſhall receive remiſſion of ſinnes. (Surely this is called <hi>The word of the Goſpel,</hi> Acts 15.7. with <hi>Acts</hi> 10.43.) Alſo that Chriſt came into the world to ſave finners; even the vileſt of ſinners, that doe or ſhall believe in him, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15, 16. Is all this, I ſay, no Goſpel? If this be Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, as indeed it is, then there remaines a Goſpel, which through the grace of God we faithfully preach unto ſinners; and God makes the preaching of this Goſpel effectuall to the converſion of his.</p>
            <p>It is further objected,<note place="margin">34. <hi>Object.</hi> From <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1.23. anſwered.</note> that true believers are grounded in the faith, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1.23. But we have no ground of our faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The ground of our faith is the divine truth of that Goſpel which we are commanded to believe; and the fulneſſe of power, and authoritie, and righteouſneſſe, and faithfulneſſe, and love, and mercy, which is in him that commands us to believe in him; which the Scripture declares, and the holy Spirit diſcovers unto us. This is a ſufficient ground of our faith: and they which build not upon this ground, will be found to build upon the ſand. <hi>Paul</hi> built upon this ground, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. And the Elect that lived in his time did build upon no other ground; ſee <hi>Acts</hi> 17.11, 12. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.16.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, it is objected, that <hi>the Devill is a lyar,</hi>
               <note place="margin">35. <hi>Object.</hi> From <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.44. anſwered.</note> 
               <hi>and there is no truth in him,</hi> Joh. 8.44. But our doctrine makes him to ſpeake truth when he ſaith to a veſſell of wrath that dyes in deſpaire; Chriſt hath not preſented to his Fathers juſtice a ſatisfaction for thy ſins. I anſwer. 1. Though the Devill be a lyar, yet ſometimes he ſpeaks ſome truth, <hi>Mark.</hi> 1.24. <hi>Acts</hi> 16.17. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28.17, 18, 19. 2. We doe no more juſtifie the Devill as ſpeaking truth herein, then the Scripture doth juſtifie him when he ſaith to a veſſel of wrath, <hi>Thou waſt before of old ordained to this condemnation,</hi> Jude 4. <hi>Yea bertunto thou waſt appointed,</hi>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:113580:45"/>1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Thou art none of Chriſts ſheep,</hi> John. 10.26. <hi>Thy judgement lingreth not, and thy damnation ſlumbreth not,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.3. 3. He that affirmes a truth to be a cretaine truth, not knowing it to he ſo, is therein a lyar. And God doth not acquaint the Devill with his counſail, further then he manifeſts the ſame to all by his Word and by his accompliſhing thereof. 4. When one ſpeakes truth malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, that by falſe inferences he may make a perſon rebell againſt truth, he is now an odious lyar. And this is the Devils caſe when he ſpeakes any truth.</p>
            <p>Now in concluſion let it be minded, that the oppoſing of the truth which I have now aſſerted, brings forth (among other) theſe evill fruits. 1. It makes men deny the truth of the Scriptures do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine concerning divine predeſtination. 2. It robs God of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his ſpeciall and ſingular love and mercy to his choſen ones. 3. It tends to puffe up believers with pride, perſwading them that they have diſtinguiſhed themſelves from the reſt of the world, and ſo ſaved themſelves: for Chriſt for his part did no more for them, then for thoſe that periſh. 4. It robs the Saints of aſſurance of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance, and ſo of aſſurance of ſalvation. For if men come to be believers by a common grace afforded to all, then they may alſo ceaſe to be believers through that weakneſſe and corruption that is in all. Now take away from Saints their aſſurance of ſalvation, and yee take away from them their joy, their thankfulneſſe, their love, their life. 5. It holds forth God as making a ſhew of being equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loving to all, when indeed and in his purpoſe he is not ſo: and ſeeming moſt graciouſly to forgive the ſinnes of all men, when yet he determines to puniſh the veſſels of wrath eternally in hell for all their ſinnes.</p>
            <p>I could ſay much more, and yet may not now with convenience enlarge this Booke any further. I therefore conclude, ſuſtaining my ſelfe againſt the errour that I have thus oppoſed, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe of the ſame, with that in 2 <hi>Time.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Nevertheleſs, the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God ſtandeth ſure, having this ſeale, The Lord knoweth them that are his.</hi>
